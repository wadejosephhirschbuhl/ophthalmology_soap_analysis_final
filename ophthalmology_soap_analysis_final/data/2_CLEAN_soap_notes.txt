CASE 01 — Acute Follicular Conjunctivitis
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Photophobia, discomfort, and headache centered around the right eye for 2 weeks
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I denied any sexual contact."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 37-year-old female office worker presents with a 2-week history of photophobia, discomfort, and headache centered around her right eye. One week into this course she developed sudden onset redness and watering of the right eye on the first day back at work after a vacation in Hawaii. She noted swelling in front of her right ear. She was seen by an eye-care practitioner and treated with a 2-week course of topical tobramycin–dexamethasone; the preauricular node became slightly smaller, but 2 days after stopping the drops she developed corneal epithelial infiltrates and persistent follicles. She reports no systemic or genital symptoms and denies sexual contact; social history notable for hotel stays and use of swimming pool facilities during travel. Visual acuity 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS.
History Narrative: A 37-year-old female office worker with a 2-week history of photophobia, discomfort, and headache centered around her right eye. A week earlier she developed sudden onset redness and watering of the right eye on her first day back at work after a vacation in Hawaii. She noted swelling in front of her right ear. She saw her eye-care practitioner, who found unilateral follicular conjunctivitis with a mildly tender preauricular node and treated her with a 2-week course of topical tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; the node became slightly smaller, but 2 days after cessation of the drops she developed epithelial infiltrates in the cornea and persisting follicles. She denies sexual contact; stayed in hotel rooms and used swimming pool facilities during vacation. No antecedent or concurrent systemic symptoms (fever, pharyngitis, upper respiratory symptoms) were reported. Visual acuity is 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. On exam there is a right-sided nontender preauricular node, 1–2 mm ptosis of the right upper lid, mild bulbar conjunctival injection OD, moderate number of medium-sized pretarsal follicles and papillae OD with fewer follicles inferiorly OS, and the right cornea shows diffuse midperipheral and a few central epithelial infiltrates without stromal involvement; left cornea and anterior segment are normal.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks prior
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Progression: Improved after cessation of steroids with development of epithelial then subepithelial infiltrates; subsequently gradual resolution expected with observation and symptomatic care (follow-up 4–6 weeks)
Characteristics: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, likely adenoviral; unilateral right-eye onset with photophobia, watering, mild injection, pretarsal follicles and papillae, nontender preauricular lymphadenopathy, corneal epithelial and midperipheral/subepithelial infiltrates after steroid cessation, no systemic symptoms.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Exposure to swimming pools and fomites (hand–eye contact, contaminated hotel surfaces)
Alleviating Factors: cool compresses and unpreserved lubricants
Associated Symptoms: Photophobia, discomfort, headache centered around the right eye, redness, watering (tearing), swelling in front of right ear (preauricular node)
Previous Episodes: No prior episodes reported
Prior Treatments: topical tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension drops (2-week course)
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild — some photophobia, discomfort, and headache affecting work/activities but vision largely preserved (20/25 OD, 20/20 OS); able to continue with precautions and symptomatic treatment.
Systemic Symptoms: None
Recent Travel: Vacation in Hawaii (returned several days before onset)
Risk Factors: Recent travel (vacation in hotel in Hawaii), use of swimming pool facilities, possible fomite exposure, prior topical corticosteroid use.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, most consistent with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis given unilateral follicular conjunctivitis, preauricular lymphadenopathy, recent fomite/swimming exposure, and development of corneal epithelial/subepithelial infiltrates after cessation of topical steroid; viral (adenovirus), HSV, and chlamydial testing were negative. Observation and supportive care recommended; consider topical steroid (e.g., loteprednol) only if visually significant subepithelial infiltrates persist, and follow-up in 4–6 weeks to monitor resolution and corneal opacities.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, likely adenoviral
Differential Diagnosis: Adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis; Adult chlamydial (inclusion) conjunctivitis; Herpes simplex/Epstein–Barr keratoconjunctivitis
Severity: Mild-to-moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Epithelial and subepithelial corneal infiltrates leading to potential corneal scarring and persistent visual disturbance (reduced visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or photophobia); conjunctival membranes/pseudomembranes with risk of symblepharon; possible spread/contagion to others.


Plan
All Medications: tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension drops; topical tobramycin–dexamethasone; unpreserved lubricants; cool compresses (supportive); loteprednol (topical corticosteroid, possible); 0.6% povidone iodine/0.1% dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension (FST-100); povidone iodine; trifluridine; vidarabine; ganciclovir ophthalmic gel; topical cidofovir; 2′3′-dideoxycytidine; interferon β; interferon γ; immunoglobulin; N-chlorotaurine; topical trifluridine therapy; systemic acyclovir 400 mg five times daily; oral acyclovir; valacyclovir; tetracycline 250 mg orally four times daily; doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; erythromycin 500 mg four times daily; sulfisoxazole 0.5–1 g four times daily; azithromycin 1 g single dose; mitomycin C (low-dose, adjunct to PTK)
All Procedures: Conjunctival scrapings for direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing and McCoy cell culture; cultures for adenovirus and herpes simplex; diagnostic testing (PCR/ELISA options discussed) — overall: conjunctival swab/culture and DFA testing.
Follow-Up Instructions: Re-examine in 4–6 weeks to confirm symptom improvement, follicle regression, and fading of corneal opacities; earlier/more frequent visits if visually threatening corneal opacities or conjunctival membranes/pseudomembranes develop.
Patient Education: Observation and symptomatic care are appropriate; use cool compresses and unpreserved lubricating drops. The condition may be contagious for one to two weeks (or longer)—practice strict personal hygiene: frequent handwashing, keep used tissues, washcloths, and pillowcases separate from others. Report worsening symptoms (increasing pain, vision loss, membranes, or severe redness). If membranes or pseudomembranes develop, removal may be performed to prevent complications. Discuss that no FDA‑approved antiviral for adenovirus exists; topical steroids (e.g., loteprednol) may be considered for visually significant subepithelial infiltrates but can increase viral shedding. Follow up in 4–6 weeks (sooner if vision threatened) to ensure resolution; contact provider sooner if symptoms worsen.


CASE 02 — Chronic Follicular Conjunctivitis
===========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Routine follow-up visit 15 months after penetrating keratoplasty; mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling.
DURATION: 15 months
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I had no ocular symptoms at that time." "She denied using any eye drops other than the prescription medications already listed." "She denied close contact with animals, including cats and birds." "She was monogamous, and she denied any gynecologic complaints."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 38-year-old female, 15 months post right penetrating keratoplasty, with 6-week history of febrile illness and persistent right preauricular lymphadenopathy; developed mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling, now with unilateral right ocular itching/irritation, mild eyelid puffiness, prominent inferior and superior tarsal follicles and papillae, mild diffuse epithelial keratoplasty epitheliopathy; chronic topical right-eye medications include loteprednol 0.5% BID, brimonidine 0.2% BID, timolol 0.5% gel BID and bedtime methylcellulose; symptoms began after systemic febrile illness treated with oral penicillin, no other systemic complaints, denies other eye drop use, animal contact, or travel.
History Narrative: A 38-year-old woman presents for routine follow-up 15 months after penetrating keratoplasty and anterior segment reconstruction of the right eye for trauma. Her eyes are comfortable but she reports mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling. Six weeks earlier she developed a febrile illness with swollen glands, particularly on the right side of her face; her internist suspected “strep throat” or mononucleosis. She had no ocular symptoms at that time. Throat culture and Epstein–Barr virus serology were negative. She was treated with oral penicillin for 14 days and recovered symptomatically except for persistent right preauricular lymphadenopathy. She is otherwise healthy with a negative review of systems. Past ocular history is significant for medically treated traumatic angle recession glaucoma of the right eye; the left eye is normal. Current right-eye medications: loteprednol etabonate 0.5% twice daily, brimonidine 0.2% twice daily, timolol gel-forming solution 0.5% twice daily, and methylcellulose at bedtime. She was last seen 3 months prior with no ocular inflammation. On exam her right visual acuity is 20/60 improving to 20/40 with pinhole, IOP 28 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. She has a slightly tender right preauricular lymph node and slight lid puffiness (right worse than left). Biomicroscopy of the right eye shows mild lid scurf; conjunctiva with prominent follicles and papillae in the inferior fornix and superior pretarsal area; no granulomas. The keratoplasty has mild diffuse epitheliopathy (hurricane epitheliopathy). Left eye shows mild pretarsal papillae without follicles and is otherwise normal. She denies use of any eye drops other than the listed prescription medications, denies close contact with animals, and has not traveled to endemic areas. She is monogamous and denies gynecologic complaints.

All Medications: preservative-free artificial tears; topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; topical steroid (e.g., mild topical steroid dosed four times daily, tapered over 2–3 weeks); ultraviolet‑blocking sunglasses (protective measure, not a medication); mitomycin C (antimetabolite, 0.02% concentration example); topical antibiotic (postoperative, four times daily); topical corticosteroid (postoperative, tapered)
All Procedures: Observation/medical management (artificial tears, topical NSAIDs, short course topical steroid tapered over 2–3 weeks, UV‑blocking sunglasses) Corneal topography Pterygium excision (under local subconjunctival anesthesia) with removal of Tenon’s capsule Conjunctival autograft (secured with sutures or fibrin glue) Amniotic membrane transplantation (secured with sutures or fibrin glue) Application of antimetabolite (mitomycin C, titrated; subconjunctival use) Irradiation Primary conjunctival anastomosis Rotational conjunctival flap Histopathologic examination of excised tissue Topical postoperative antibiotic therapy and tapered topical corticosteroid
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up dictated by symptom severity and proximity to visual axis; earlier follow-up if topical steroids are used (to assess response and intraocular pressure)
Patient Education: Avoid excessive sun and wind exposure; wear ultraviolet‑blocking sunglasses and hats. Use preservative‑free artificial tears regularly for lubrication. If inflamed or symptomatic, short course of topical steroid may be prescribed (typically four times daily, tapered over 2–3 weeks) — return early if symptoms recur. If surgery is recommended, understand recurrence risk (may be high without adjuncts; adjunctive measures like conjunctival autograft, amniotic membrane, or mitomycin C can lower recurrence but have risks). Seek prompt re‑evaluation for progressive growth affecting vision, recurrent inflammation, or any new atypical appearance.


CASE 05 — Recurrent Erosion/Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy
==================================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden onset of unilateral eye pain with foreign body sensation, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision upon awakening
DURATION: Sudden onset upon awakening (acute)
LATERALITY: Unilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I awoke with sudden pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, light sensitivity, and blurred vision when I opened my eyes."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 35-year-old woman awakened with sudden onset of unilateral severe eye pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening her eyes. She reports multiple prior similar episodes occurring in either eye, no history of ocular trauma, and a positive family history (mother) of similar episodes. Visual acuity in the involved eye was 20/400.
History Narrative: A 35-year-old woman awoke from sleep with sudden onset of unilateral pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening her eyes. The patient had a previous history of multiple similar episodes occurring in either eye. The patient’s mother has also been affected with similar episodes. She had no history of prior ocular trauma. Visual acuity is 20/400 in the involved eye and 20/20 in the fellow eye. Slit-lamp examination of the involved eye revealed a large, discrete area of epithelial sloughing. The edges of the epithelial defect were remarkable for a “heaped-up” appearance. No infiltrate was apparent. Fluorescein dye revealed pooling over the epithelial defect. Examination of the fellow eye was remarkable for diffuse, superficial gray-white opacities in a “map” and “dot” configuration.
Symptom Onset: Upon awakening / immediately upon opening her eyes
Symptom Duration: Upon awakening (sudden onset at time of awakening)
Progression: Recurrent
Characteristics: Map lines, fingerprint lines, and dots (diffuse superficial gray-white opacities; “heaped-up” epithelial edges with large sheet-like epithelial sloughing; spontaneous awakening onset; often bilateral; autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance)


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Awakening/opening the eye after sleep (shear/traction from eyelid on loosely adherent epithelium)
Alleviating Factors: Eyelid closure during sleep (removing eyelid-induced shear), topical lubrication (nonpreserved artificial tears and ointment), hypertonic 5% sodium chloride drops/ointment, bandage contact lens, pressure patch, prophylactic topical antibiotic ointment, cycloplegia, self-retained amniotic membrane grafts.
Associated Symptoms: pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision
Previous Episodes: multiple similar episodes occurring in either eye
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant — acute episodes cause severe pain, photophobia, tearing and blurred vision (vision 20/400 in affected eye) that markedly impair activities (especially morning awakening, reading/driving) and may require treatment/patching, thus substantially limiting daily function during attacks.
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: Mother
Risk Factors: Recurrent corneal epithelial erosions; epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy (autosomal dominant family history); female sex; prior episodes in either eye; underlying corneal dystrophy (diffuse abnormal basement membrane)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome secondary to epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy of the cornea. Left (involved) eye with acute large epithelial sheet defect with heaped-up edges, fluorescein pooling, no infiltrate; visual acuity 20/400 OD? (involved eye) and fellow eye 20/20 with diffuse map‑dot‑fingerprint changes consistent with bilateral dystrophy. History of recurrent episodes in either eye and positive family history. Recommend acute management with topical antibiotic ointment and pressure patch or bandage contact lens (±cycloplegia for pain), consider self‑retained amniotic membrane if needed; for recurrent/recalcitrant disease consider total epithelial debridement, anterior stromal micropuncture, or PTK. Maintain lubrication long‑term with frequent preservative‑free artificial tears and nighttime ointment; consider 5% sodium chloride drops/ointment for several months to promote epithelial adherence. Follow closely until epithelial healing and monitor for infectious keratitis; evaluate corneal topography if vision remains irregular.
Primary Diagnosis: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome, basement membrane dystrophy type
Secondary Diagnoses: Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (Map‑dot‑fingerprint dystrophy)
Differential Diagnosis: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome due to epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy; Post‑traumatic recurrent corneal erosion; Other epithelial basement membrane dystrophies (Meesmann’s, Reis–Bücklers)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: delayed corneal wound healing and refractive changes


Plan
All Medications: topical antibiotic ointment cycloplegia (topical cycloplegic) soft bandage contact lens (device) self-retained amniotic membrane grafts (Prokera, AmbioDisk) (biologic devices) topical antibiotic ointment, cycloplegia, and pressure patch (combination) topical antibiotic ointment, patch, bandage contact lens 5% sodium chloride drops 5% sodium chloride ointment nonpreserved artificial tears artificial tear ointment
All Procedures: antibiotic prophylaxis (topical antibiotic ointment), cycloplegia, pressure patching, bandage soft contact lens, self-retained amniotic membrane graft (cryopreserved Prokera or dehydrated AmbioDisk), epithelial debridement/scraping (manual removal of epithelium), anterior stromal micropuncture (25-gauge needle micropunctures), excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), corneal topography
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful follow‑up until the epithelial defect has fully resolved; monitor for infectious keratitis. After healing, maintain frequent lubrication with nonpreserved artificial tears 4–8×/day and artificial tear ointment at bedtime. Consider hypertonic 5% sodium chloride drops during the day and 5% ointment at night for ~3+ months to promote epithelial adherence. Obtain corneal topography if vision is affected (irregular astigmatism or haze).
Patient Education: You have recurrent corneal erosions due to epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy. This causes the corneal surface to be loosely adherent and can lead to painful episodes—often upon awakening—causing pain, tearing, light sensitivity, and blurry vision. Key points and home care: - It is usually a chronic, often inherited condition; examine both eyes because changes can be bilateral. - During an acute episode, treatment promotes healing and prevents infection: topical antibiotic ointment, pressure patch or bandage contact lens, and sometimes cycloplegic drops for pain; amniotic membrane grafts may be used in clinic. Seek care promptly for sudden pain, worsening vision, increasing redness, or discharge. - Long‑term measures to reduce recurrences: frequent nonpreserved artificial tears during the day (4–8×/day) and ointment at bedtime; consider hypertonic 5% sodium chloride drops by day and ointment at night for several months to help the epithelium adhere. - If episodes are frequent or vision is affected, procedures (debridement, anterior stromal micropuncture, or PTK) can produce longer symptom‑free periods. Discuss risks and benefits with your ophthalmologist. - Watch for signs of infection and follow up until the epithelial defect heals.
Emergency Instructions: Seek urgent ophthalmic care if severe pain, worsening vision, increasing redness, discharge, or fever occur; until evaluation, apply preservative-free artificial tears or antibiotic ointment if prescribed, avoid rubbing the eye, wear an eye shield or patch, and use topical cycloplegic for pain if prescribed.


CASE 06 — Fuchs’ Corneal Dystrophy
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Slowly progressive loss of vision, worse in the left eye, initially worse in the morning with diurnal fluctuation but more recently poor throughout the day
LATERALITY: OU
PATIENT QUOTES: "Initially, her vision was worse upon awakening and gradually cleared as the day went on; more recently, however, her vision remained poor throughout the day."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 60-year-old woman with slowly progressive vision loss greater in the left than right eye. Initially vision worse upon awakening and gradually cleared during the day (diurnal fluctuation), but more recently vision remained poor throughout the day. Current corrected visual acuities 20/200 OD and counting fingers at 4 ft OS. Left greater than right central microcystic epithelial edema and stromal edema with Descemet membrane folds; corneal guttatae and endothelial pigmentation centrally OU. Moderate nuclear sclerotic cataracts OU. IOP 14 mm Hg OU.
History Narrative: A 60-year-old woman presented with a history of slowly progressive loss of vision in the left greater than the right eye. Initially, her vision was worse upon awakening and gradually cleared as the day went on; more recently, however, her vision remained poor throughout the day. Examination revealed corrected visual acuities of 20/200 in the right eye and counting fingers at 4 feet in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14mm Hg in each eye. Slit-lamp examination of the cornea revealed central microcystic epithelial edema and stromal edema with folds in Descemet’s membrane in the left greater than the right eye. Corneal guttatae and endothelial pigmentation extended over the central portion of the cornea in both eyes. The anterior chamber was deep and quiet, and the iris was normal in both eyes. Moderate nuclear sclerotic cataracts were present bilaterally, and dilated fundus examination revealed normal posterior poles through a hazy view. B-scan ultrasonography of the posterior poles was unremarkable.
Symptom Onset: Slowly progressive; initially worse in morning and cleared during day, more recently vision remained poor throughout the day (chronic progressive over months to years).
Symptom Duration: Slowly progressive (present for years)
Progression: Slowly progressive
Characteristics: Slowly progressive central corneal endothelial dysfunction with corneal guttata, central stromal and microcystic epithelial edema (worse in the morning), decreased endothelial cell density, pleomorphism/polymegathism, potential endothelial pigmentation, increased central corneal thickness on pachymetry, diurnal vision fluctuation, eventual bullous keratopathy and possible corneal scarring in advanced disease.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Worse vision in the morning due to eyelid closure/surface evaporation decrease (diurnal variability), activities that increase corneal hydration (sleeping/overnight eye closure)
Alleviating Factors: Vision gradually cleared as the day went on; hypertonic NaCl drops/ointment and corneal dehydration (hair dryer) reduce morning blur.
Associated Symptoms: Slowly progressive loss of vision (worse in left eye), morning blur/diurnal vision fluctuation with worse vision on awakening, episodes of sharp pain from ruptured epithelial bullae (in advanced disease)
Prior Treatments: Hypertonic sodium chloride drops (NaCl 5%) and hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime; supportive measures including hair-dryer corneal dehydration.
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant — vision markedly reduced (worse in morning, progressed to persistent impairment) impairing daily activities, more in left eye (CF at 4 ft)
Systemic Symptoms: None
Risk Factors: Female sex, increasing age (typically >50 years), family history/genetic predisposition, and cataract surgery or other endothelial trauma

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 1. Fuchs’ corneal dystrophy OU with more advanced disease OS than OD, manifesting as central microcystic epithelial edema, stromal edema with Descemet folds, central corneal guttata and endothelial pigmentation, and markedly reduced vision OS > OD (CF 4 ft OS, 20/200 OD). 2. Bilateral moderate nuclear sclerotic cataracts. 3. IOP 14 mm Hg OU, deep quiet anterior chambers, normal-appearing irides, hazy but otherwise unremarkable posterior poles on dilated exam and B-scan. 4. Corneal decompensation OS greater than OD with symptomatic visual decline and morning worsening consistent with endothelial failure; consider pachymetry/specular microscopy for staging and surgical planning. 5. Management options discussed: medical therapy (hypertonic NaCl drops/ointment, hair-dryer dehydration) for early symptomatic relief; surgical options for vision rehabilitation include endothelial transplantation (DSAEK or DMEK) or PKP if stromal scarring present; consider combined cataract extraction with endothelial procedure if central pachymetry >600 µm or based on surgical assessment.
Primary Diagnosis: Fuchs’ corneal dystrophy OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Cataract OU
Differential Diagnosis: Pseudophakic/aphakic bullous keratopathy; Angle-closure glaucoma with endothelial decompensation; Herpes simplex/varicella-zoster stromal keratitis; Posterior polymorphous dystrophy
Severity: Advanced
Laterality: OU
Complications: - Corneal decompensation with stromal and epithelial edema - Bullous keratopathy with painful epithelial bullae and potential epithelial rupture - Corneal scarring limiting visual outcome - Need for corneal transplantation (DSAEK, DMEK, or PKP) - Graft-related complications: rejection, graft failure, dislocation (after endothelial keratoplasty) - Postoperative astigmatism requiring suture management or further surgery - Accelerated cataract progression after PKP or cataract surgery–related endothelial trauma reducing graft survival - Persistent decreased visual acuity despite treatment


Plan
All Medications: hypertonic sodium chloride (NaCl 5%) ophthalmic solution; hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime; balanced salt solution (BSS) plus irrigation fluid; topical antibiotic drops (postoperative); topical corticosteroid drops (postoperative); nonpreserved artificial tears
All Procedures: hypertonic sodium chloride (NaCl 5%) drops; hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime; BSS plus irrigation during cataract surgery; use of dispersive or viscoadaptive viscoelastic for endothelial protection during phacoemulsification; endocapsular and chop phacoemulsification techniques; Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK); Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK); penetrating keratoplasty (PKP); simultaneous cataract extraction and IOL placement with/without endothelial transplant; selective suture lysis and/or running suture adjustment; rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting; astigmatic keratotomy; compression sutures; wedge resection; repeat penetrating keratoplasty; LASIK (after suture removal and secure wound)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Postoperative topical antibiotic and corticosteroid drops (antibiotics until surface re-epithelializes; steroids tapered slowly over 6–12 months) - Use ointments and/or nonpreserved artificial tears as needed for ocular surface rehabilitation - Minimize number and frequency of preserved topical drops to avoid surface toxicity - After DSAEK/DMEK: remain supine until the air bubble is absorbed to allow graft attachment - After PKP: manage postoperative astigmatism with selective suture lysis and/or running suture adjustment guided by topography; prescribe glasses or RGP lenses when appropriate - Monitor for graft attachment, corneal clarity, and signs of rejection or infection; follow routine postoperative visits per surgeon protocol
Patient Education: Fuchs’ endothelial dystrophy is a slowly progressive condition in which the innermost layer of the cornea (the endothelium) thins and develops guttae, leading to fluid buildup in the cornea that causes blurred vision—often worse in the morning. Early disease may cause only intermittent “morning blur” and can often be managed with conservative measures: hypertonic saline drops (NaCl 5%) during the day, hypertonic ointment at bedtime, and simple dehydration (e.g., directing a hair dryer on low from arm’s length for a few minutes). As the disease progresses, epithelial bullae can form and cause pain and persistent vision loss. Definitive treatment for visually significant corneal edema is endothelial transplantation (DSAEK or DMEK) or, when scarring is present, penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). If cataract surgery is needed, corneal thickness and endothelial status help determine whether to combine cataract extraction with an endothelial transplant. After corneal transplant, expect topical antibiotics and steroids, a prolonged steroid taper (6–12 months), and positioning (supine) after DSAEK/DMEK until the air bubble resolves. Regular follow-up with pachymetry/specular microscopy and your cornea specialist is important to monitor progression and plan surgery when vision or symptoms warrant. If you develop sudden severe pain, decreased vision, or signs of infection, seek prompt ophthalmic care.


CASE 07 — Keratoconus
=====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: gradual decreased vision in his right eye over the past year
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I don't see clearly."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 19-year-old man with one-year history of gradual decreased vision in the right eye; long history of glasses/contacts (9 years) with recent prescription change and new contacts that do not improve vision; reports vision was previously correctable to 20/20 until last year; denies trauma, surgery, or recent eye infection.
History Narrative: A 19-year-old man with a nine-year history of glasses and contact lens wear presents with gradual decreased vision in his right eye over the past year. He reports his vision had been correctable to 20/20 until last year and despite a recent prescription change and new contact lenses he does not see clearly. He denies trauma, surgery, or recent eye infection. Past medical history is significant for seasonal allergies; he is allergic to penicillin and uses acetaminophen occasionally. He denies family history of eye disease and has a negative review of systems. He is currently wearing contact lenses.
Symptom Onset: 1 year
Symptom Duration: 1 year
Characteristics: Noninflammatory ectasia of the central cornea with progressive central/paracentral thinning, irregular astigmatism and steepening (cone-shaped protrusion), Vogt’s striae, Fleischer ring (epithelial iron deposition), usually bilateral but asymmetric, associated with corneal scarring and hydrops in advanced disease.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Eye rubbing and atopic seasonal allergies
Alleviating Factors: Rigid gas permeable contact lens use improving vision to 20/30

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 19-year-old man with keratoconus of the right eye. Progressive decreased vision OD over one year with asymmetric high irregular astigmatism (manifest refraction OD −2.00 −7.50 ×60, corrects to 20/100 with glasses, RGP over-refraction improves to 20/30), slit-lamp signs of keratoconus including central corneal thinning, Vogt’s striae, and partial Fleischer ring; ultrasound pachymetry 450 μm OD and 480 μm OS; topography with inferior steepening OD and mild thinning OS. No evidence of scarring, inflammation, or posterior segment pathology. IOPs normal; otherwise healthy. Diagnosis: keratoconus OD (bilateral disease likely asymmetric). Management: continued rigid gas-permeable contact lens rehabilitation for vision; monitor for progression with pachymetry and topography; consider corneal collagen cross-linking if progression occurs and surgical options (INTACS, DALK, PKP) if contact lens intolerance, progressive thinning, or scarring. Follow both eyes regularly for progression.
Primary Diagnosis: Keratoconus in the right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Seasonal allergies
Differential Diagnosis: Keratoconus; Pellucid marginal degeneration; Keratoglobus; Terrien’s marginal degeneration
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: residual astigmatism, myopia, glaucoma, cataract, mydriasis, graft rejection


Plan
All Medications: acetaminophen; topical corticosteroids; riboflavin (with ultraviolet light for corneal cross-linking); rigid gas-permeable contact lenses; scleral or specialty hybrid contact lenses (as options)
All Procedures: rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting; corneal topography (computerized videokeratoscopy/Placido-disc topography); ultrasound pachymetry; corneal collagen cross-linking (UV light/riboflavin); intracorneal ring segments (INTACS) implantation; deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK); penetrating keratoplasty (PKP)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow corneal status with regular exams while wearing rigid gas-permeable contact lens; monitor the left eye for development of keratoconus changes; consider corneal topography/pachymetry surveillance and contact lens reassessment; pursue surgical options (cross-linking, INTACS, DALK, or PKP) if progression, contact lens intolerance, or central scarring occur.
Patient Education: Keratoconus is a noninflammatory thinning and bulging of the central cornea that causes irregular astigmatism and decreased vision. It is usually bilateral but often asymmetric. Typical signs include decreased vision not fully correctable with glasses, corneal thinning, Vogt’s striae, and Fleischer ring; diagnosis is supported by corneal topography and pachymetry. Management depends on severity: early disease is managed with glasses or specialty contact lenses (rigid gas-permeable, scleral, or hybrid) to improve vision; progressive disease may be treated with corneal collagen cross-linking (riboflavin + UV) to slow progression. Advanced or scarring cases may require surgery (DALK or penetrating keratoplasty; intracorneal ring segments can help in selected cases). Avoid eye rubbing, control allergies, and use prescribed contact-lens hygiene. Regular follow-up with corneal topography and pachymetry is recommended to monitor progression; report any sudden vision decrease, pain, or redness promptly.


CASE 08 — Microbial Keratitis
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision, pain, photophobia, redness, and discharge in left eye for 48 hours
DURATION: 48 hours
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have decreased vision, pain, photophobia, redness, and discharge in my left eye for the previous 48 hours."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 39-year-old woman with a history of contact lens wear presenting with 48 hours of decreased vision, pain, photophobia, redness, and purulent discharge in the left eye; left vision initially CF at 3′ with central dense gray-white necrotic-appearing corneal stromal infiltrate with epithelial loss, indistinct edges, 2+ anterior chamber cell/flare and 1-mm hypopyon.
History Narrative: A 39-year-old woman with a history of contact lens wear presents with 48 hours of decreased vision, pain, photophobia, redness, and discharge in her left eye. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and count fingers at 3 feet OS. Right eye exam was unremarkable. Left external exam showed mild lid and conjunctival edema, a papillary conjunctival reaction, and a purulent discharge. The corneal stroma had a central, dense, gray‑white, necrotic-appearing infiltrate with loss of the overlying corneal epithelium; the edges of the infiltrate were indistinct and extended beyond the stromal opacity. The anterior chamber showed 2+ cell and flare and a 1‑mm hypopyon. The iris, lens, and retinal examinations were unremarkable. Subsequent exams: at 4 days vision 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS with minimal lid and conjunctival edema, scant purulent discharge, a condensing gray‑white corneal opacity with defined borders, and epithelial ingrowth at the edges; at 11 days vision 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS with further condensation of the stromal opacity and continued re‑epithelialization; at 1 month vision 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS with a central corneal stromal opacity.
Symptom Onset: 48 hours
Symptom Duration: 48 hours
Progression: Central dense necrotic infiltrate with epithelial defect → condensing gray-white stromal opacity with defined borders and partial re-epithelialization by day 4 → further condensation of stromal opacity and continued re-epithelialization by day 11 → central corneal stromal opacity with improved vision to 20/50 at 1 month
Characteristics: Central, dense, gray-white, necrotic-appearing stromal infiltrate with loss of overlying epithelium; indistinct, spreading edges; purulent discharge; 2+ AC cell/flare with 1 mm hypopyon; condensing gray-white stromal opacity with re-epithelialization over time


Subjective (cont.)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Streptococcal corneal ulcer, left eye, in a 39-year-old contact lens wearer presenting with 48 hours of decreased vision, pain, photophobia, redness, and purulent discharge. Exam OS: central dense gray-white necrotic-appearing stromal infiltrate with epithelial defect, indistinct margins, 2+ AC cell/flare and 1 mm hypopyon; VA CF 3′ initially, improving to 20/400 by day 4 and 20/50 by one month with condensation of stromal opacity and re-epithelialization. Cultures grew a Streptococcus species. Plan: aggressive topical broad-spectrum fortified antibiotics tailored to gram-positive organism with frequent dosing, possible substitution with a fluoroquinolone, careful consideration of topical steroids only after clinical improvement and culture guidance, adjunctive cycloplegia and enzyme inhibitors as indicated, and surgical intervention (glue or PK) reserved for impending or actual perforation. Follow-up for re-epithelialization, scar management, and modification of contact lens use to reduce recurrence risk.
Primary Diagnosis: Streptococcal corneal ulcer, left eye
Differential Diagnosis: Bacterial keratitis (contact lens–associated bacterial corneal ulcer); Fungal keratitis; Acanthamoeba keratitis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS
Complications: Corneal scarring; potential corneal perforation requiring glue or penetrating keratoplasty; reduced graft survival if keratoplasty performed in infected/inflamed cornea; decreased visual acuity.


Plan
All Medications: moxifloxacin 0.5% topical, prednisolone sodium phosphate 1% topical, fortified aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin/amikacin) topical, fortified cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin/ceftazidime) topical, fluoroquinolones topical, penicillins (topical/systemic), synthetic penicillins topical, erythromycin topical, bacitracin topical, polymyxin topical, chloramphenicol topical, vancomycin topical, tetracycline (doxycycline oral for enzyme inhibition), sulfonamides topical/systemic, rifampin topical/systemic, topical corticosteroid drops (general), subconjunctival antibiotics (general)
All Procedures: scraping/corneal ulcer culture (corneal scrapings with plating onto media) topical fortified antibiotic therapy (e.g., hourly fortified agents and/or fluoroquinolones) subconjunctival antibiotic injections intravenous antibiotics (hospitalization for severe cases) topical corticosteroid drops (adjunctive, started after initial antibiotics per SCUT) cycloplegic agents oral doxycycline (enzyme inhibitor adjunct) collagen shield placement impregnated with antibiotics bandage contact lens placement self-retained amniotic membrane graft corneal glue application with bandage contact lens penetrating keratoplasty (therapeutic PK) deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) conjunctival flap (not indicated for perforation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Once infection is controlled, evaluate and correct risk factors for recurrence (stop or modify contact lens wear and hygiene, treat lid/lacrimal/conjunctival dysfunction). Consider contact lens options (rigid gas-permeable or scleral) for visual rehabilitation of irregular cornea. For central or deep stromal scarring, discuss phototherapeutic keratectomy, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, or penetrating keratoplasty as indicated.
Patient Education: Educate the patient that her condition is a bacterial corneal ulcer likely related to contact lens wear; emphasize immediate, aggressive topical antibiotic therapy is necessary to prevent vision loss and that strict adherence to the prescribed hour‑by‑hour drops (initially very frequent) is critical. Explain the importance of returning for follow‑up examinations to monitor healing, and that cultures helped identify Streptococcus to guide treatment. Advise to stop contact lens wear until fully healed and to review proper lens hygiene and avoid overnight wear in the future. Warn about potential complications: corneal scarring that can decrease vision, possible need for surgical interventions (glue or corneal transplant) if perforation or medical failure occurs, and that steroid drops may be considered later only under close supervision. Instruct to seek urgent care for worsening pain, vision loss, increasing redness, or new discharge.
Work Restrictions: Avoid contact with work environments that risk ocular contamination or require contact lens wear; avoid heavy manual labor or activities risking eye trauma until corneal healing confirmed; follow up for return-to-work clearance once vision stabilizes and ocular surface healed.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care for sudden worsening—increasing pain, vision loss, new flashes/floaters, or if eye becomes increasingly red, swollen, or discharging; cover the eye with a shield, avoid topical drops not prescribed, do not wear contact lenses, and go to the emergency department or clinic right away.


CASE 09 — Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca—Dry Eye
============================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: ocular irritation in both eyes
LATERALITY: bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "burning, foreign body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, and redness, more in his right eye." "These symptoms were worse in the morning and also in the later part of the day, and made him unable to read or drive comfortably." "He still has preserved emotional lacrimation." "He stated that he slept on his stomach, preferring his right side."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus referred for second opinion for unstable ocular surface/dry eye, complaining of bilateral ocular irritation—burning, foreign body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, and redness worse in the right eye. Symptoms worse in the morning and later in the day, interfering with reading and driving; preserved emotional lacrimation. Sleeps on stomach favoring right side. Noted reduced blink rate; right worse than left.
History Narrative: A 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and a chief complaint of ocular irritation in both eyes was referred by an ophthalmologist for a second opinion under the impression of an unstable ocular surface due to dry eye in his right eye. He complained of burning, foreign body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, and redness, more in his right eye. These symptoms were worse in the morning and also in the later part of the day, and made him unable to read or drive comfortably. He still has preserved emotional lacrimation. He stated that he slept on his stomach, preferring his right side. While taking the history, it was noted that his blink rate was reduced in both eyes. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. External examination did not reveal features suggestive of rosacea. There were no palpable preauricular nodes. The lid position and relationship to the globe were normal, while the lid tension was loose and floppy. Lid tension was graded as 2+ in the right eye and 1+ in the left eye. On slit-lamp examination, the meibomian secretion was normal as its fluid appeared clear and was easily expressible. The height of the tear meniscus was low in the upper and lower lids of both eyes. Both tarsal and bulbar conjunctivae were diffusely injected with the tarsal conjunctiva, showing a mixed papillary and follicular response. Ocular sensitivity was markedly reduced as measured by a Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometer. The tear breakup time in each eye was less than 2 seconds. Fluorescein showed superficial punctate staining and rose bengal staining was positive over the exposure zone, more prominent in the right eye. Intraocular pressure was 15 and 16 mm Hg, in the right and left eye, respectively. Fluorescein clearance test (FCT) revealed marked delayed dye clearance and decreased tear secretion in both eyes. The lens and the fundus were unremarkable in both eyes.
Progression: Chronic
Characteristics: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) due to aqueous tear deficiency from diabetes-induced neurotrophic keratopathy, with delayed tear clearance from reduced blink rate and floppy eyelids; bilateral, right worse than left, symptoms: burning, foreign body sensation, gritty, redness, worse morning and late day; low tear meniscus (<0.2 mm), TBUT <2 s, positive fluorescein and rose bengal staining, markedly reduced corneal sensitivity, Schirmer (near 0 mm), preserved emotional tearing.

Plan
All Medications: proparacaine; Fluress (fluorescein 0.25%); artificial tears (preservative-free); ophthalmic gels and ointments; Lacrisert; autologous serum eye drops; pilocarpine; cevimeline; topical cyclosporine; topical corticosteroids (prednisolone, fluorometholone, loteprednol etabonate); oral tetracyclines; oral macrolides; topical macrolides; punctal plugs (device, not a medication)
All Procedures: Schirmer test; Fluorescein clearance test; Fluorescein tear breakup time testing; Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometry (ocular sensitivity testing); Instillation of topical anesthetic (proparacaine) and fluorescein; Schirmer strip testing with nasal stimulation; Reflective meniscometry; Anterior-segment OCT tear meniscus measurement; Videokeratography for tear-film analysis; Interferometry (e.g., LipiView) for lipid layer; Tear osmolarity testing (e.g., TearLab); Tear-protein/inflammatory biomarker testing (e.g., InflammaDry); Ocular surface thermography; Application of preservative-free artificial tears, gels, ointments; Lacrisert insertion; Autologous serum eye drops; Topical cyclosporine; Topical corticosteroid drops/ointments; Oral/topical tetracyclines and macrolides; Pilocarpine/cevimeline (systemic parasympathomimetics); Punctal plugs insertion; Thermal cauterization of puncta (punctal occlusion); Surgical punctal occlusion (thermal cautery) with consideration of permanent occlusion; Tarsorrhaphy; Botulinum toxin–induced ptosis; Conjunctival flap surgery; Repair of eyelid malposition (e.g., ectropion repair); Scleral or bandage contact lens placement; Self-retained amniotic membrane (ProKera or similar) placement; Warm compresses and lid hygiene; Thermal pulsation (e.g., LipiFlow); Intense pulsed light therapy; Lid massage
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up with the ophthalmologist in 4–6 weeks to reassess symptoms, tear breakup time, staining, and fluorescein clearance; sooner if worsening pain, vision loss, marked redness, or signs of infection. Continue prescribed preservative‑free artificial tears frequently; use ointment/gel at night. Begin recommended adjuncts (warm compresses, lid hygiene, punctal plugs or other treatments as discussed) and report intolerance or side effects of medications (e.g., topical cyclosporine or steroids). Consider rheumatology referral/testing if systemic symptoms suggest Sjögren’s or autoimmune disease.
Patient Education: Explain that your symptoms are from dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) caused by reduced tear production from diabetes-related corneal nerve damage and poor tear clearance from reduced blinking and floppy lids. Recommend frequent preservative‑free artificial tears (gels/ointments at night), warm compresses and lid hygiene to support oils, and strategies to increase blink rate (conscious blinking during reading/driving). Avoid preservative-containing drops when used frequently. Use punctal plugs or thermal punctal occlusion if drops are insufficient (after controlling inflammation). For significant inflammation short courses of topical steroid or topical cyclosporine may be used under supervision. Sleep position modification (avoid sleeping on the right side) can reduce morning worsening. Report worsening pain, vision loss, or signs of infection immediately. Follow up regularly; consider referral for specialty therapies (autologous serum, scleral lens, amniotic membrane) if symptoms/signs do not improve.


CASE 10 — Postsurgical Corneal Edema
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year
DURATION: 1 week
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with 1 year of progressively decreased vision in both eyes, worse at night, who underwent uncomplicated left cataract phacoemulsification and presented on postoperative day 1 with persistent blurred vision and diffuse central and temporal corneal edema in the left eye; prior history notable for 10 years of well-controlled diabetes, otherwise unremarkable ocular history.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man with a 10-year history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus presented with a 1-year history of decreased vision (worse at night) in both eyes.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 55-year-old man status post uncomplicated phacoemulsification with postop diffuse central and temporal corneal edema of the left eye causing decreased vision. Exam: postoperative day 1 VA 20/100 OS, IOP 18 mm Hg, diffuse corneal edema on slit-lamp. Fellow-eye specular microscopy showed low endothelial cell density without guttata, indicating preexisting low endothelial reserve as etiology. Diagnosis: postoperative corneal edema due to preexisting low endothelial cell density exacerbated by surgery. Plan: medical management with frequent topical corticosteroids, topical hypertonic saline, control IOP/inflammation as needed; monitor pachymetry/specular counts and consider endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK/DMEK) or penetrating keratoplasty if edema persists or decompensation occurs.
Primary Diagnosis: Postsurgical corneal edema
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus (well controlled)
Differential Diagnosis: Preexisting endothelial disease/dysfunction (e.g., Fuchs’ dystrophy or low endothelial cell density); surgical trauma to the endothelium or Descemet’s detachment; postoperative toxic endothelial injury (medication/contaminant exposure); elevated postoperative IOP (including pupillary block)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% topical (hourly acute then topical corticosteroids qid for 1 week) 5% sodium chloride topical solution/ointment (hypertonic saline) qid for 1 week topical ophthalmic aqueous suppressants (if IOP elevation) topical antiglaucoma medications (if IOP elevation) systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (if IOP elevation) intracameral epinephrine (mentioned as potential toxicant; preservative‑free recommended) intracameral preservative‑free lidocaine (recommended) subconjunctival corticosteroid injection (considered for severe inflammation) cyclosporin A (systemic immunotherapy, selective patients)
All Procedures: phacoemulsification via temporal clear corneal incision with implantation of a posterior chamber acrylic intraocular lens; specular microscopy; corneal pachymetry; topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone acetate 1%); topical hypertonic saline (5% sodium chloride) solution/ointment; therapeutic hydrophilic contact lens fitting; penetrating keratoplasty (PK); Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK); Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK); subconjunctival corticosteroid injection; topical and systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (for IOP control); topical antiglaucoma medications
Follow-Up Instructions: Topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline 4 times daily for 1 week; follow-up visit in 1 week to assess corneal clarity and visual acuity (earlier if worsening symptoms or pain)
Patient Education: Corneal edema after cataract surgery is usually temporary. It results from reduced function of the corneal endothelial cells that normally pump fluid out of the cornea. Treatment aims to reduce inflammation, lower any elevated eye pressure, and draw fluid out of the cornea so vision can recover. What happened to you - After your cataract operation the cornea became swollen (cloudy), causing blurred vision. This can be due to preexisting low endothelial cell counts or temporary surgical trauma. What we are doing - Strong topical steroid drops to reduce inflammation. - Hypertonic saline (5% sodium chloride) drops/ointment to help remove fluid from the cornea. - If eye pressure is high, glaucoma medicines or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may be used. - In mild cases a therapeutic soft contact lens can improve comfort and vision. - If edema does not improve over weeks to months, surgical options that replace only the damaged inner corneal layer (DSAEK or DMEK) or, less commonly, full-thickness corneal transplant (PK) can restore vision. What you can expect - Many cases improve gradually over days to weeks with medical treatment; vision often returns as the edema clears. - Follow-up visits with measurements of corneal thickness and endothelial cell assessment may be done to monitor recovery. - Return sooner if you have increased pain, worsening vision, redness, or sensitivity to light. Self-care and precautions - Use prescribed drops exactly as directed and finish the course unless advised otherwise. - Avoid rubbing the operated eye. - Keep follow-up appointments; notify your doctor if symptoms worsen. - Ask before using any other eye drops, especially over-the-counter products. When surgery may be needed - If corneal edema is persistent and significantly limits vision despite medical therapy, endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK or DMEK) is an effective option to replace damaged endothelial cells and improve vision.


CASE 11 — Dellen
================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to filtering bleb (dellen) with fluorescein pooling and epithelial cell loss in right eye.
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with glaucoma status post multiple prior filtration procedures who developed elevated IOP on maximal medical therapy and underwent repeat trabeculectomy with a new flap at the 7 o’clock position to avoid prior site; two weeks postoperatively he was found to have a moderately elevated filtering bleb from 5 to 8 o’clock and developed peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to the bleb with fluorescein pooling and a small area of epithelial cell loss.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man with a history of glaucoma that required multiple filtration procedures in the right eye was found to have elevated intraocular pressure on maximal medical therapy. A repeat trabeculectomy procedure was performed. In order to avoid the previous surgical site, the trabeculectomy flap was established at the 7 o’clock position, which resulted in a moderately elevated filtering bleb extending from the 5 to 8 o’clock positions. Two weeks after surgery, peripheral corneal thinning was noted adjacent to the filtering bleb. Fluorescein instillation revealed pooling with a small area of epithelial cell loss.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks after surgery
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Progression: Two weeks after surgery; peripheral corneal thinning noted adjacent to the bleb
Characteristics: - Associated with underlying dry eye or meibomian gland dysfunction - Well-circumscribed, “saucerlike” area of peripheral corneal thinning with sloping edges - Often adjacent to an obvious limbal elevation disrupting tear distribution (e.g., filtering bleb, dermoid, conjunctival elevation) - Tear film disrupted over the area with blinking; fluorescein may pool in the depression - Epithelium usually intact at the base (unless chronic desiccation leads to epithelial breakdown, scarring, or true tissue loss) - Area rehydrates and thickens rapidly with generous viscous lubrication and patching, confirming diagnosis


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Dry eye / inadequate tear distribution (including meibomian gland dysfunction, blepharitis/meibomitis) and adjacent limbal elevation from a filtering bleb (or other conjunctival elevation)
Alleviating Factors: Rehydration with generous viscous lubricating agents (e.g., 1% methylcellulose or ophthalmic ointment) and patching for 15–30 minutes; preservative‑free artificial tears, bland lubricating ointment, punctal occlusion, bandage contact lens or self‑retained amniotic membrane graft; oral doxycycline and vitamin C (if extreme thinning); lid hygiene (warm compresses and meibomian gland massage)
Associated Symptoms: Dry eye symptoms (ocular irritation/irritation), pooling of fluorescein indicating localized epithelial cell loss (possible epithelial breakdown), signs of meibomian gland dysfunction/blepharitis (lid disease)
Prior Treatments: multiple filtration procedures in the right eye; repeat trabeculectomy (trabeculectomy flap at 7 o’clock)
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild to moderate temporary impact due to ocular irritation and visual disturbance from peripheral corneal thinning, manageable with lubrication and usually not causing long‑term functional disability.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: - Elevated filtering bleb (limbal/conjunctival elevation) - Dry eye disease - Meibomian gland dysfunction / blepharitis - Prior filtration/conjunctival surgery - Poor tear distribution due to adjacent limbal elevation

Slit Lamp Exam Description: Moderately elevated filtering bleb from 5 to 8 o’clock with adjacent well‑circumscribed peripheral “saucer‑like” corneal thinning (delle) at the temporal periphery of the right cornea with fluorescein pooling in the excavation; epithelium largely intact on base after removal of excess dye; no significant conjunctival injection or corneal infiltrate noted.


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Delle in right eye due to dry eye in the setting of a filtering bleb.
Primary Diagnosis: Delle in right eye due to dry eye in the setting of a filtering bleb
Secondary Diagnoses: Glaucoma (history of multiple filtration procedures); Dry eye; Meibomian gland dysfunction / blepharitis
Differential Diagnosis: Dellen; Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (inflammatory autoimmune causes e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Mooren’s ulcer); Degenerative peripheral thinning (Terrien’s marginal degeneration, pellucid marginal degeneration)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Corneal epithelial breakdown progressing to true noninfectious corneal ulceration with stromal tissue loss, scarring, and potential progressive thinning (keratolysis)


Plan
All Medications: doxycycline, vitamin C, preservative-free artificial tears (lubricating drops), ophthalmic lubricating ointment, methylcellulose 1% solution, oral doxycycline
All Procedures: trabeculectomy; fluorescein instillation; punctal occlusion; application of preservative‑free artificial tears and ophthalmic lubricating ointment; oral doxycycline; oral vitamin C; bandage contact lens placement; self‑retained amniotic membrane graft; secured amniotic membrane grafting; limited tarsorrhaphy; surgical removal/excision of conjunctival elevation/pyogenic granuloma/dermoid; meibomian gland treatments (warm compresses and gland massage); LipiFlow thermal pulsation system
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe and treat long term for signs and symptoms of dry eye contributing to dellen formation; monitor healing and watch for progression or recurrent thinning, with escalation to bandage contact lens, amniotic membrane graft, oral doxycycline/vitamin C, punctal occlusion, or surgical intervention (amniotic membrane grafting and/or limited tarsorrhaphy) if nonresponsive.
Patient Education: Dellen are a localized area of peripheral corneal thinning caused by poor tear coverage, often next to a raised area on the eye (e.g., a filtering bleb). They can usually be treated successfully with frequent preservative-free artificial tears, a bland lubricating ointment at night, and measures to improve eyelid oil (warm compresses and lid massage). Punctal occlusion may be used to conserve tears. If thinning persists, oral doxycycline and vitamin C, a bandage contact lens, or an in‑office amniotic membrane graft can be recommended; surgery (amniotic membrane with or without tarsorrhaphy) is reserved for refractory cases. Avoid rubbing the eye, use prescribed drops as directed, and return promptly for follow-up if pain, increased redness, vision change, or growing epithelial defect occurs.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 30-year-old man status post penetrating keratoplasty OD (5 months) presenting with 1 week of redness, photophobia, and decreased vision. Exam OD: VA 20/400 no pinhole improvement, 2+ ciliary injection, broken exposed interrupted suture with surrounding infiltrate at 11 o'clock, marked stromal edema extending 2 mm into graft from suture site, line of keratic precipitates at central edge of edema, AC 1+ cell and flare, IOP 17 mm Hg. Diagnosis: broken suture with suture abscess and endothelial corneal graft rejection OD. OS: keratoconus with rigid gas permeable lens, VA 20/20. Management plan: remove broken suture at slit lamp, culture and treat suture abscess with topical fortified fluoroquinolone, reduce/discontinue topical steroid initially if abscess present then resume/increase topical prednisolone acetate 1% frequently (up to hourly) for endothelial rejection with taper over weeks as response permits; consider cycloplegic for comfort; monitor closely with follow-up in 2–4 days; consider systemic or subconjunctival steroids if severe or recalcitrant; if no improvement over weeks, consider repeat PK or DSAEK depending on corneal status.
Primary Diagnosis: Endothelial corneal graft rejection
Secondary Diagnoses: Broken suture with suture abscess; Keratoconus (left eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Epithelial graft rejection; Subepithelial graft rejection; Endothelial graft rejection; Suture abscess/infectious keratitis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: Broken suture with suture abscess; endothelial corneal graft rejection; corneal stromal edema extending into graft; keratic precipitates; anterior chamber inflammation (1+ cell and flare); potential graft vascularization leading to graft failure


Plan
All Medications: Polytrim (trimethoprim/polymyxin) drops; bacitracin ointment; topical fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin) drops; prednisolone acetate 1% drops; scopolamine 0.25% drops; oral prednisone; subconjunctival/transseptal triamcinolone; systemic cyclosporin A
All Procedures: penetrating keratoplasty (PK); suture removal at the slit lamp; corneal suture lysis; topical antibiotic application (e.g., Polytrim, bacitracin, fluoroquinolone); corneal culture for suture abscess; topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone acetate 1%); cycloplegic agent use (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%); systemic corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone); subconjunctival/transseptal steroid injection (e.g., triamcinolone); repeat penetrating keratoplasty (repeat PK); Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK); rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting
Follow-Up Instructions: Typically follow up every 2–4 days for more severe rejection or ~1 week for less severe cases; decrease visit frequency as rejection is controlled and topical steroids are tapered, then return to visual rehabilitation (suture lysis, glasses, or rigid contact lens fitting as appropriate).
Patient Education: Seek evaluation within 24 hours for any new photophobia, foreign body sensation, redness, or decreased vision; understand that timely presentation is critical to prevent graft failure. Remove broken sutures promptly; follow prescribed topical antibiotics for prophylaxis or treatment of suture abscesses. Be aware that epithelial/subepithelial rejections can trigger endothelial rejection and to report symptoms early. Expect frequent follow-up (every 2–4 days for severe episodes or weekly for milder cases) while undergoing treatment and gradual tapering of topical steroids as inflammation resolves.
Emergency Instructions: Seek evaluation within 24 hours of any new symptoms (photophobia, foreign body sensation, red eye, or decreased vision).

Follow-Up Instructions: Initial follow-up in 3–6 weeks (earlier if on topical steroids to monitor response and IOP); thereafter as needed or at routine visits. Continue maintenance lid hygiene, warm compresses, and artificial tears; reinforce chronic, relapsing nature and tailor regimen to symptom severity.
Patient Education: Blepharitis is a chronic, relapsing eyelid inflammation that requires regular eyelid hygiene and maintenance. Perform daily gentle lid cleaning (cotton‑tip or lid scrubs with mild shampoo or a commercial lid cleanser such as hypochlorous 0.01%), use warm compresses to soften debris, and gently massage lids to express oils as needed. Use preservative‑free artificial tears 4–8×/day for dry eye symptoms. Apply topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) at bedtime for more severe staphylococcal flares as directed. Short courses of topical steroids may be used for severe inflammation under supervision. Consider oral omega‑3 supplementation (1–3 g/day DHA/EPA) for meibomian dysfunction. Avoid frequent/rough handling of the lids. Return for follow‑up in 3–6 weeks if severe or sooner if using steroids or if symptoms are worsening or unilateral/asymmetric (to evaluate for possible malignancy).


CASE 14 — A Nearly Mature Cataract in a Patient with Glaucoma
=============================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Nearly mature cataract in the right eye (with glaucoma)
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 34-year-old Caucasian woman referred for evaluation of a nearly mature cataract in the right eye; complex ocular history notable for congenital glaucoma with multiple prior right‑eye surgeries (goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, trabeculectomy), phthisical left eye, progressive vision loss in the right eye to counting fingers, inability to dilate pupil due to 360° posterior synechiae, and concern for zonular compromise.
History Narrative: A 34-year-old Caucasian woman with a complex ocular history including congenital glaucoma and a phthisical left eye was referred for evaluation of a nearly mature cataract in her right eye. She had undergone numerous prior right-eye glaucoma surgeries (goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, and a trabeculectomy) and intermittently used glaucoma medications and bleb massage. Visual acuity was finger counting in the right eye and no light perception in the left. She had a functioning superior-nasal peripheral iridotomy used as an entrance pupil and a relatively thick-walled but functioning superior-nasal filtering bleb. IOP was 20 mm Hg off medications. The cornea showed a few guttae; the anterior chamber was deep and quiet. The iris was highly atrophic with very little sphincter tissue, a 3 mm pupil that did not dilate due to 360° posterior synechiae, multiple sphincterotomies at the pupillary margin, and a large radial cut at 12 o’clock. There was a dense, nearly mature cataract with absence of visible zonules through the large superior-nasal iridectomy and questionable zonular status in other quadrants. No view of the right fundus was obtainable.
Progression: Progressive


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: - Congenital glaucoma with prior multiple intraocular surgeries (goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, trabeculectomy) leading to zonular compromise - Monocular status with phthisical fellow eye - Functioning superior nasal filtering bleb limiting surgical access - Atrophic iris with 360° posterior synechiae and radial sphincterotomies (small, non-dilating pupil) - Large axial myopia (axial length 30 mm) and large white-to-white (>14 mm) - Corneal endothelial compromise from prior surgeries (few guttae) increasing risk of decompensation - Unreliable preoperative measurements (keratometry/topography discordance)
Prior Treatments: Goniotomies; peripheral iridectomies; sphincterotomies; trabeculectomy

Assessment Narrative: Lens particle glaucoma of the left eye secondary to retained lens fragments after complicated cataract surgery, with elevated IOP (38 mm Hg), anterior chamber inflammation (2+ cell and flare), iridodonesis, ectopia lentis and prolapsed vitreous; retinal exam without macular/optic nerve pathology. Hypothesis supported by gonioscopy showing fluffy lens particles in the angle. Acute IOP elevation and inflammation requiring aggressive medical therapy and prompt pars plana vitrectomy, lensectomy, and IOL placement. Postoperative course: IOP normalized to 12 mm Hg without medications and final uncorrected VA improved to 20/30 OS.
Primary Diagnosis: Lens particle glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Lens particle glaucoma; Phacolytic glaucoma; Phacoantigenic (phacoantigenic) glaucoma; Angle-recession glaucoma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: glaucoma, inflammation, retinal detachment, chronic inflammation, disabling visual floaters, refractory cystoid macular edema


Plan
All Medications: timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, atropine, prednisolone acetate, topical beta-blocker, alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, glycerin (mentioned as to avoid in diabetics), isosorbide, mannitol, frequent topical corticosteroids, periocular or systemic corticosteroids, prostaglandin analogs (not used in inflamed eye)
All Procedures: Pars plana vitrectomy; lensectomy; intraocular lens (IOL) placement; gonioscopy; slit‑lamp biomicroscopy; dilated fundus examination; pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy with phacofragmatome (as described)
Patient Education: You have lens fragments left in your eye from a previous cataract surgery, which can cause inflammation, high eye pressure, pain, redness, and vision loss. Immediate steps: - Take prescribed eye‑pressure lowering drops (timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine) exactly as directed. - Use frequent steroid drops (prednisolone acetate) to reduce inflammation and atropine to prevent painful spasms and synechiae. - Avoid rubbing the eye and heavy lifting; protect the eye from further trauma. Why surgery may be needed: - If pressure remains high or vision is poor, a pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy (removal of lens fragments) with IOL placement may be recommended to remove the debris, relieve inflammation, and prevent optic nerve damage. - Surgery is often done urgently if there is uncontrolled pressure, vitreous prolapse, significant inflammation, or retinal concerns; timing may be within days to weeks depending on your exam. What to expect after treatment: - Pressure often improves after surgery; you may be able to stop some glaucoma drops. - Vision can improve significantly (example case improved to 20/30), but recovery may take weeks and depends on retinal and optic nerve health. - You will need frequent follow‑up visits for IOP checks, inflammation monitoring, and retinal exams. When to contact the clinic urgently: - Sudden worsening of vision, severe eye pain, new flashes/floaters, increasing redness, or nausea/vomiting with eye pain. Medications and follow‑up summary: - Continue all prescribed drops; return for scheduled visits and IOP checks; bring a list of medications and any history of diabetes or prior eye surgeries to each visit.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic evaluation for acute eye pain, redness, decreased vision, or markedly elevated intraocular pressure; while awaiting care, use prescribed IOP-lowering drops, frequent topical corticosteroids and cycloplegic/mydriatic as directed, and avoid miotics.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Postoperative fibrinous anterior chamber reaction with meshwork of fibrin deposition over the intraocular lens following combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL implantation and trabeculectomy (5 days post‑op). Moderate AC cells and flare, no hypopyon. Left eye: quiet postoperative course with rare AC cells and well‑positioned IOL; poor vision from advanced glaucoma. Plan: intensify topical steroid (prednisolone acetate 1% frequently, up to hourly as needed), consider intracameral tPA if fibrin persists or is vision‑threatening, monitor for endophthalmitis, IOP, and cystoid macular edema; follow closely.
Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: Postoperative fibrin deposition on the intraocular lens
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Fibrinous postoperative anterior uveitis (fibrin deposition on IOL); Acute postoperative endophthalmitis; Persistent severe postoperative inflammation with pupillary membrane formation (severe iridocyclitis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: AC turbidity; corneal edema; elevated intraocular pressure; bleeding; corneal toxicity; band keratopathy; endophthalmitis; posterior synechiae; loss of iris function; membrane formation on the IOL; dislocation of the IOL; glaucoma; cystoid macular edema; posterior capsular opacification; infectious keratitis


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (one drop every 2 hours initially, listed dosing range 4–6×/day up to hourly) and ofloxacin (four times a day)
All Procedures: Combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (right eye); same procedures performed in left eye one month earlier.
Follow-Up Instructions: Regular eye examinations at regular intervals to monitor visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and for signs of infection or recurrent inflammation; adjust visits based on severity (e.g., within days to weekly initially) and after resolution continue routine postoperative follow-up.
Patient Education: Fibrin deposition on the intraocular lens is a common inflammatory reaction after eye surgery that usually appears 2–14 days afterward and can cause decreased vision, redness, pain, and light sensitivity. It is not the same as infection (endophthalmitis), but if you have severe pain, markedly worse vision, or increasing redness/chemosis, contact the clinic urgently. Treatment and what to expect: - Main treatment is intensive topical steroid drops (e.g., prednisolone acetate). Use exactly as prescribed and do not stop suddenly; follow-up exams will guide tapering. - Antibiotic drops may be continued after surgery per your surgeon’s instructions. - In severe cases, an injection of tPA into the anterior chamber can dissolve fibrin, but this is less commonly needed and has risks (temporary cloudiness, corneal swelling, IOP rise, bleeding, infection). - Surgery is rarely needed acutely unless the lens is dislocated or inflammation is uncontrolled. Warnings and side effects to watch for: - Signs suggesting possible infection or serious complication: severe eye pain, rapidly worsening vision, increasing redness, discharge, or new floaters — seek immediate care. - Steroid side effects: increased eye pressure (may cause glaucoma) and increased risk of infection; you will need IOP checks. - Report any new light sensitivity, worsening vision, or pain between visits. Follow-up and prevention: - Keep all scheduled follow-ups to monitor vision, inflammation, and eye pressure. - Use prescribed drops exactly as directed; do not skip doses. - Pre- and intraoperative anti-inflammatory measures can reduce risk in future procedures. If you have questions about your drops, symptoms, or follow-up schedule, contact your ophthalmology clinic.

Plan
All Medications: Nd:YAG laser (neodymium: yttrium–aluminum–garnet)
All Procedures: Phacoemulsification with capsule retractors, capsular tension ring (CTR) strategies (including Cionni/Malyugin modified CTR with scleral fixation) and/or Ahmed capsular tension segment placement with possible sulcus three-piece foldable IOL implantation with optic-capture; pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy (if posterior descent or significant vitreous prolapse); possible scleral- or iris-sutured posterior chamber IOL, intrascleral haptic fixation (“glued” IOL), or anterior chamber/iris-claw IOL as alternatives.
Follow-Up Instructions: Regular ophthalmologic follow-up with monitoring of visual acuity, IOP, and dilated fundus exam; periodic assessment for progression of zonular dialysis in both eyes and for retinal detachment; cardiac evaluation/echocardiography for Marfan’s-related aortic or valvular disease (if not already done); counsel regarding symptoms warranting prompt review (sudden vision loss, new floaters/photopsias, increased glare or diplopia); plan surgical intervention if visual symptoms/complications (progressive decentration, pupillary block, corneal compromise, or lens-induced glaucoma/amblyopia) develop.
Patient Education: Education about Marfan’s-associated lens subluxation, including that the displaced lens can cause blurred vision, glare, and changes in refractive error that may be managed initially with glasses or contact lenses; the importance of monitoring for complications (pupillary block/angle-closure, corneal endothelial damage, vitreous prolapse, retinal detachment); that bilateral subluxation often reflects a systemic disorder (Marfan’s) with serious cardiac risks so family screening and prompt echocardiography are recommended to evaluate for aortic or valvular disease; treatment options if vision is unacceptable—surgical choices include phacoemulsification with capsular support devices (capsule retractors, capsular tension rings/segments, sutured rings) or pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy, and various IOL fixation methods (in-bag/sulcus with CTR, sutured or scleral-fixated posterior IOL, anterior chamber or iris-claw IOL); signs and symptoms that should prompt urgent care (sudden vision loss, severe pain, acute redness, sudden floaters or flashes); and the need for long-term ophthalmic follow-up and discussion of genetic counseling for family members.

Primary Diagnosis: Bilateral idiopathic congenital cataract
Differential Diagnosis: Retinoblastoma; Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV); Retinal detachment; Coats’ disease
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: posterior capsular opacification; secondary membrane formation/capsule opacification; glaucoma (including late-onset, higher if surgery <4 weeks); retinal detachment


Plan
All Medications: atropine
All Procedures: B-scan ultrasonography; ophthalmoscopy with dilated pupils; indirect ophthalmoscopy with 20-D lens; direct ophthalmoscopy; slit-lamp examination (hand‑held or standard); laboratory testing (blood and urine tests for TORCH titers, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, urine amino acids, galactose metabolism enzymes); genetic consultation; ophthalmic ultrasound examination; examination under anesthesia including intraocular pressure measurement; pharmacologic mydriasis (atropine) therapy; patching/occlusion therapy for amblyopia; cataract extraction (lensectomy) with posterior capsulotomy/capsulectomy; intraocular lens (IOL) implantation (with targeted refraction planning); postoperative pupil dilation/medical management; fitting with contact lenses or aphakic spectacles; long‑term glaucoma surveillance.
Follow-Up Instructions: Excellent refractive correction and prompt optical rehabilitation (contact lenses if unilateral; spectacles if bilateral) with power chosen to favor near (myopic) correction; aggressive occlusion/patching therapy for amblyopia as prescribed; regular long‑term follow‑up visits to monitor visual development, refractive changes, posterior capsular/membrane opacification, and intraocular pressure for glaucoma (may appear years later).
Patient Education: Congenital cataract is a lens opacity present at birth or within the first year that can cause vision loss if not treated early. Early detection and timely treatment are critical—dense bilateral cataracts are usually removed by about 10 weeks of age and unilateral cataracts by 4–6 weeks to reduce the risk of permanent amblyopia. Not all cataracts need immediate surgery; small, peripheral, or punctate opacities may be observed. Preoperative testing may include dilated eye exam, ultrasound if the retina cannot be seen, and blood/urine tests for infections or metabolic causes when cataracts are bilateral. If surgery is recommended, understand: - Procedure basics: removal of the cloudy lens; posterior capsule is typically opened to prevent re‑opacification. - IOL (artificial lens) considerations: usually avoided before age 1; if used, target hyperopia or emmetropia based on age and growth; IOLs carry higher inflammation and complication risk. - Risks: postoperative glaucoma (can occur years later), posterior capsule opacification, membrane formation, and rarely retinal detachment. Postoperative care and rehabilitation: - Immediate and consistent refractive correction is essential—aphakic infants need contact lenses or glasses; spectacles are commonly used for bilateral cases, contact lenses preferred for unilateral cases. - Amblyopia therapy (patching the better eye) and regular visual rehabilitation are crucial and require strict adherence. - Frequent follow‑up visits for refraction changes, intraocular pressure checks, and monitoring for late complications. When to seek urgent care: - Increased redness, swelling, discharge, marked pain (or excessive irritability in infants), sudden change in vision, or signs of infection. Support and resources: - Genetic counseling if dysmorphic features or family history. - Coordination with pediatrics for systemic workup if bilateral or syndromic features. - Ask your ophthalmologist about expected visual outcomes, lens options, patching schedule, and long‑term follow‑up plan.
Referrals: Genetic consultation and pediatrician for metabolic evaluation (laboratory testing of blood and urine)

Assessment Narrative: Ocular hypertension — 42-year-old Caucasian man with IOPs 27 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS, normal visual acuity 20/20 OU, open angles 360° with moderate TM pigmentation, symmetric optic nerves with C/D 0.2 and intact neuroretinal rims OU, normal 24-2 Humphrey visual fields; no evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy or secondary cause on slit-lamp or gonioscopy. Plan: observe with periodic IOP, optic nerve exams, annual VF/OCT; consider treatment based on risk factors and follow-up interval 6–12 months (or sooner if therapy initiated).
Primary Diagnosis: Ocular hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Idiopathic ocular hypertension; Primary open-angle glaucoma (early POAG); Secondary glaucoma from pigment dispersion syndrome; Secondary glaucoma from pseudoexfoliation syndrome
Severity: Mild
Laterality: OU


Plan
All Procedures: Goldmann applanation tonometry Central corneal thickness measurement (pachymetry) Gonioscopy Slit-lamp examination (including red-free light) Dilated funduscopic examination (stereoscopic optic nerve assessment) Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) 24–2 Humphrey automated perimetry Laser peripheral iridotomy (mentioned as possible treatment) Laser trabeculoplasty (mentioned) Glaucoma filtration surgery (mentioned)
Follow-Up Instructions: Initially be seen at least every 6–12 months. Yearly visual field testing and/or OCT and dilated optic nerve exam. If treated, return within 4 weeks after starting therapy; once IOP is stable after adjustments, exam every 4–6 months for at least 2 years. If stable for many years, exam every 6–12 months.
Patient Education: Educate patient that he has ocular hypertension — elevated eye pressure without optic nerve or visual field damage — and explain the risks: higher pressure can increase lifetime risk of developing glaucoma, especially with additional risk factors. Review the recommended monitoring plan: follow-up every 6–12 months with IOP checks, annual visual field testing and/or OCT and dilated optic nerve exams; if treatment is started, return in ~4 weeks to assess effectiveness and then every 4–6 months for at least 2 years until stable. Discuss central corneal thickness measurement importance in interpreting IOP, and that treatment is individualized (no single IOP “cutoff”); outline potential options if treatment becomes necessary (topical IOP-lowering medications first; laser or surgery generally avoided unless optic nerve damage or progression). Advise promptly reporting any vision changes, eye pain, or symptoms suggesting angle closure or secondary causes, and encourage adherence to follow-up and therapy if prescribed.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Primary open-angle glaucoma in a 51-year-old African American man, characterized by elevated intraocular pressures (26 mm Hg OD, 32 mm Hg OS), open angles on gonioscopy (grade IV with clear ciliary body band 360°), optic nerve cupping with inferior rim thinning OU (more marked OS), and corresponding superior arcuate visual field defects (early OD, more advanced OS). No signs of secondary glaucoma (no Krukenberg spindle, iris transillumination defects, pseudoexfoliation, or inflammatory findings). Visual acuity 20/20 OU. Plan: initiate IOP-lowering therapy and close follow-up with target IOP at least 20% below baseline, baseline optic nerve imaging and pachymetry if not already obtained, and repeat visual fields and optic nerve assessment to monitor for progression; consider escalation to laser trabeculoplasty or surgical intervention if pressure or structural/functional progression occurs.
Primary Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Mild emphysema
Differential Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma; Pigmentary glaucoma; Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma; Optic neuropathy from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: β-blockers topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prostaglandin analogs adrenergic agonists miotics apraclonidine 5-fluorouracil mitomycin C
All Procedures: Applanation tonometry; Refraction; Pupillary reaction testing; Slit-lamp anterior segment examination; Gonioscopy; Dilated stereoscopic funduscopic optic nerve examination; Red-free nerve fiber layer assessment; Automated static threshold visual field testing; Ultrasound corneal pachymetry (recommended/mentioned); Retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve head imaging (OCT/confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy/scanning laser polarimetry)
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequency of follow‑up based on disease severity, achievement of target IOP, evidence of progression, and duration of control. At each visit assess medication side effects and compliance, visual acuity, IOP, and optic nerve. Repeat visual field testing and optic nerve evaluation (including baseline stereoscopic photos) as indicated. Adjust therapy for failure to reach target IOP, progressive optic nerve/visual field loss, or medication side effects/noncompliance.
Patient Education: You have primary open‑angle glaucoma, a chronic eye condition where elevated eye pressure damages the optic nerve and can cause progressive, irreversible vision loss if untreated. Key points: - Goal of treatment: lower your intraocular pressure (IOP) to a target at least ~20% below your pretreatment level (or lower if damage is advanced) to slow or prevent further nerve damage. - Importance of treatment adherence: take eye drops exactly as prescribed (dose, timing), and report side effects. Often start one eye first to assess response. - Monitoring: regular follow-up visits for visual acuity, IOP checks, optic nerve examination, and visual field testing are essential. Baseline optic nerve photos and periodic imaging (OCT/RNFL) help track progression. - Possible treatments: topical medications (beta‑blockers, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists, miotics), laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) as an option if drops are insufficient or not tolerated, and surgical options (trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage devices, or minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries) if medications/laser fail. - What symptoms to watch for: sudden vision loss, eye pain, redness, severe headache, nausea/vomiting — seek urgent care if these occur (could indicate acute problems or complications). - Lifestyle and risk factors: avoid smoking; use inhaled medications carefully and inform your ophthalmologist about all medical conditions and medicines (some systemic meds affect eye pressure). - Expected course: glaucoma is usually lifelong; with proper treatment and follow‑up you can often preserve useful vision. - Next steps for you: discuss medication choice and side effects, consider SLT if adherence is a concern, schedule regular follow‑ups and baseline imaging/visual fields as recommended.

Primary Diagnosis: Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (left eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Pupillary block primary angle-closure glaucoma; Plateau iris configuration; Phacomorphic (lens-induced) angle-closure glaucoma; Secondary angle-closure from uveitic or neovascular causes
Severity: Acute
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: isosorbide glycerol mannitol acetazolamide pilocarpine (2% topical) topical beta-blockers alpha-2 agonists prostaglandin analogs topical corticosteroids antiemetics analgesics
All Procedures: laser iridotomy; medical therapy to lower IOP (osmotic agents such as isosorbide/glycerol or IV mannitol; IV or oral acetazolamide; topical beta-blockers; topical alpha-2 agonists; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; topical pilocarpine); topical corticosteroids; therapeutic paracentesis (if needed); laser iridoplasty; surgical goniosynechialysis; cataract extraction (if lens-induced component)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Measure IOP within 30–120 minutes after laser surgery. - Examination within 1 week post‑laser. - Additional follow-up at 4–8 weeks postoperatively. - Taper topical corticosteroids during the postoperative period. - Consider pupillary dilation with postdilation IOP check and gonioscopy to confirm angle remains open; perform more frequent visits if response inadequate.
Patient Education: You have acute primary angle‑closure glaucoma in your left eye, which occurs when the drainage angle inside the eye becomes blocked, causing a rapid rise in eye pressure. This can cause blurred vision, eye pain, redness, halos around lights, nausea, and a mid‑dilated pupil. Immediate treatment is needed to lower the pressure and prevent vision loss. Initial treatment may include medicines to rapidly lower pressure (oral/IV osmotic agents like isosorbide or mannitol, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide, topical beta‑blockers or alpha‑agonists) and pilocarpine drops to constrict the pupil if the iris is responsive. Pain and nausea can be treated symptomatically. Once the cornea clears and pressure is controlled, a laser peripheral iridotomy (small hole in the iris) is usually performed to relieve the pupillary block and open the angle. The fellow (right) eye is often at risk and a prophylactic iridotomy is commonly recommended. After treatment you will need close follow‑up: IOP checks shortly after the procedure (within 30–120 minutes), again within a week, and at 4–8 weeks. Use prescribed topical steroid drops as directed and report increasing pain, redness, worsening vision, or severe nausea/vomiting immediately. Avoid pupil‑dilating drops until after the iridotomy and follow instructions about activity and medications. Family members may need screening because of increased risk.
Referrals: Ophthalmology (glaucoma specialist) for urgent evaluation and laser peripheral iridotomy; prophylactic iridotomy for the fellow eye.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care (go to ER or eye clinic) if you develop severe eye pain, sudden vision loss or worsening blurred vision, colored halos, marked eye redness, nausea or vomiting. Do not dilate the pupil; avoid driving. If already diagnosed with angle closure, take prescribed IOP‑lowering medications (e.g., oral isosorbide/glycerol or acetazolamide, topical beta‑blocker/pilocarpine) only as instructed and get to urgent care for definitive treatment (laser iridotomy).


CASE 22 — Pigmentary Glaucoma
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Routine eye examination, no complaints

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 32-year-old myopic man with bilateral pigmentary glaucoma. Best-corrected VA 20/20 OU. IOPs elevated at 28 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS. Slit-lamp: Krukenberg spindles OU and extensive spoke-like iris transillumination defects bilaterally. Gonioscopy: open angles 360° OU with dense, even trabecular meshwork pigmentation (Sampaolesi’s line). Optic nerves: OD cup-to-disc ~0.7 with inferotemporal rim thinning; OS cup-to-disc ~0.55. SD-OCT RNFL: moderate inferotemporal thinning OD and mild thinning OS. Automated perimetry: moderate superior arcuate defect OD and early nasal step OS. Overall assessment: moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma OD with superior arcuate defect; moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma OS with early nasal step. Management considerations: initiate IOP-lowering therapy aiming for 20–30% reduction (medical therapy such as prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, CAIs or alpha agonists), consider miotic therapy if tolerated, and discuss laser options (initial monocular 180° ALT given heavy TM pigmentation; consider LPI to reduce iris–zonule chafe though evidence limited). If medical/laser therapy inadequate or progression continues, consider incisional surgery (trabeculectomy, Ex-Press, or drainage implant) or MIGS depending on severity and surgeon preference. Arrange baseline optic nerve photos, baseline and serial SD-OCT and automated perimetry, and close follow-up to monitor IOP, optic nerve, and fields.
Primary Diagnosis: Moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma (OU)
Secondary Diagnoses: Myopia
Differential Diagnosis: Pigmentary glaucoma; Primary open-angle glaucoma; Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma; Intraocular/intraocular tumor–related pigment dispersion (e.g., melanoma)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: pilocarpine prostaglandin analogs beta-blockers carbonic anhydrase inhibitors alpha-adrenergic agonists
All Procedures: Laser peripheral iridotomy; Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT); Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT); Trabeculectomy; Ex‑Press glaucoma mini‑shunt implantation; Glaucoma drainage implant placement; Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (e.g., iStent trabecular microbypass, gonioscopy‑assisted transluminal trabeculotomy, endocyclophotocoagulation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up should be individualized based on treatment effectiveness, disease stability, severity, and patient reliability (schedule visits and testing accordingly).
Patient Education: Pigmentary glaucoma is caused by pigment released from the back of the iris blocking drainage and raising eye pressure. It most commonly affects young myopic men. Symptoms can include blurry vision, especially with exercise, but many patients are asymptomatic. Important points: - Regular monitoring is essential: you will need periodic IOP checks, optic nerve exams, visual field testing, and OCT imaging to track any damage. - Treatment aims to lower IOP to prevent progression and may include eye drops (prostaglandins, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists), laser procedures (laser trabeculoplasty; sometimes laser peripheral iridotomy), or surgery if needed. - Avoid activities that trigger pigment release and IOP spikes (intense exercise) until your doctor advises otherwise. - Report new symptoms such as vision changes, eye pain, or severe headache promptly. - Adhere to prescribed medications and appointments; bring a list of your eye drops to visits and alert any provider to eye medications before other treatments.

Plan: urgent IOP lowering with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and topical aqueous suppressants, consider hyperosmotic agents with caution, topical steroid and cycloplegic for inflammation/pain; obtain panretinal photocoagulation when view allows and perform intravitreal anti-VEGF injection once retinal detachment and intraocular tumor are excluded (consider anterior chamber paracentesis if IOP remains very high); if medical therapy fails, proceed to glaucoma drainage device (Ahmed or Baerveldt) after anti-VEGF to reduce bleeding risk; cyclodestructive procedures or enucleation reserved for blind, painful eyes.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute ocular hypertension secondary to neovascular glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; diabetes; arteriosclerosis; ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (right eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Neovascular glaucoma; Acute angle-closure glaucoma (primary or secondary); Traumatic hyphema/angle-recession glaucoma; Acute iridocyclitis
Severity: Acute
Laterality: right


Plan
All Medications: oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors topical beta-blockers topical alpha-2 agonists topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors topical prednisolone cycloplegics intravitreal anti-VEGF injection hyperosmotic agents prostaglandin analogs antiemetics (non-oral/sublingual) aqueous shunting device (surgical implant)
All Procedures: Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (systemic IOP lowering) Topical aqueous suppressants (beta‑blocker, alpha‑2 agonist, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) Topical prednisolone Topical cycloplegic Antiemetics (sublingual or non‑oral route) Anterior chamber paracentesis Intravitreal anti‑VEGF injection Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) when view permits Aqueous shunt implantation (e.g., Baerveldt or Ahmed) Trabeculectomy (rarely, after neovascularization controlled) Venting tube incisions / tube ligation management (for nonvalved implants) Cyclodestructive procedures (diode or Nd:YAG laser; cryotherapy) Retrobulbar alcohol injection Enucleation
Follow-Up Instructions: Urgent ophthalmology follow-up for IOP monitoring and further management; arrange prompt retina evaluation for panretinal photocoagulation and consideration of intravitreal anti‑VEGF once posterior pathology is assessed; if discharged, return sooner for any worsening pain, vision loss, or persistent nausea/vomiting.
Patient Education: Neovascular glaucoma is caused by abnormal blood vessels that block fluid drainage in the eye, causing a rapid and painful pressure rise that can damage vision. Because this often follows retinal ischemia (e.g., from a vein occlusion or diabetes), treating the underlying cause and promptly lowering eye pressure are essential. Emergency treatments may include oral and topical pressure-lowering medications, possible removal of fluid from the eye, and injections of anti-VEGF medicine to reduce abnormal vessel growth. Once stable, laser treatment of the retina (panretinal photocoagulation) or glaucoma surgery (implant/shunt) may be needed to control pressure long-term. Close follow-up is required to monitor pressure, inflammation, and vision; report worsening pain, vision loss, nausea/vomiting, or increasing redness immediately. If the eye is painful with no visual potential, procedures to reduce pain can be discussed.
Referrals: Ophthalmology (glaucoma specialist) urgently; retina specialist for panretinal photocoagulation and evaluation; emergency medicine for systemic management (if not already involved)
Emergency Instructions: Lower IOP quickly (oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ± topical aqueous suppressants such as beta‑blocker, alpha‑2 agonist, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor); consider hyperosmotic agents with caution; manage inflammation/pain with topical prednisolone and cycloplegic; control nausea/vomiting nonorally; if view permits, give panretinal photocoagulation; consider intravitreal anti‑VEGF once retinal detachment/tumor/traction ruled out (may perform anterior chamber paracentesis before/after IVI if IOP very high); prepare for glaucoma surgery (aqueous shunt) if medical therapy fails; in blind painful eyes consider cyclodestruction, retrobulbar alcohol, or enucleation.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis with secondary open-angle (inflammatory) glaucoma of the left eye. Acute presentation with decreased vision, corneal stellate keratic precipitates, patchy pupillary sphincter iris atrophy, 2+ anterior chamber cells and flare, open angles with trabecular meshwork pigmentation and no PAS, and markedly elevated IOP (46 mm Hg) consistent with inflammatory glaucoma likely due to herpetic etiology. Management directed at controlling inflammation (topical corticosteroids, cycloplegia, consider oral acyclovir) and acutely lowering IOP with aqueous suppressants; close follow-up with gonioscopy and optic nerve monitoring, and escalate to surgical intervention if pressure remains uncontrolled or glaucomatous damage develops.
Primary Diagnosis: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis; Secondary open angle glaucoma (inflammatory glaucoma)
Differential Diagnosis: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis; Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis; HLA-B27–associated anterior uveitis; Posner–Schlossman syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: glaucomatous optic neuropathy, peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) formation, cataract, cystoid macular edema (CME), band keratopathy, steroid-induced IOP elevation


Plan
All Medications: trifluridine, prednisolone 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%, rimexolone, loteprednol, flurbiprofen, ketorolac, diclofenac, methotrexate, azathioprine, timolol, levobunolol, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, apraclonidine, dipivefrin, latanoprost, topical trifluridine (prophylaxis), oral acyclovir, atropine, cyclopentolate, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequent follow-up with IOP checks, slit‑lamp exam and gonioscopy to monitor inflammation and angle/PAS formation; regular optic nerve evaluation and visual field testing to detect glaucomatous change; monitor for complications (CME, band keratopathy) and treat inflammation with steroids as needed despite IOP risk; adjust glaucoma therapy or consider surgery if IOP uncontrolled.
Patient Education: You have inflammation in your eye (herpes simplex anterior uveitis) that has caused a large rise in eye pressure (inflammatory glaucoma). Treatment has two goals: control the inflammation and lower the pressure to protect the optic nerve and your vision. You may need topical steroid eye drops (frequent at first, then tapered) to reduce inflammation and topical or oral glaucoma medicines (such as beta-blockers or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) to lower the pressure. Cycloplegic drops (e.g., atropine) can relieve pain and help prevent synechiae. If infection is suspected or confirmed, antiviral therapy (topical trifluridine or oral acyclovir) is used. Some medicines (miotics, and sometimes prostaglandin drops) are avoided or used with caution in uveitis. If pressure remains high despite medication, laser or glaucoma surgery (drainage device or trabeculectomy) may be needed, but surgery is usually delayed until inflammation is controlled. You will need frequent follow-up exams with pressure checks, slit-lamp and gonioscopy to monitor inflammation, angle status, optic nerve appearance, and visual fields. Report promptly any increased pain, worsening vision, new floaters, or redness. Long-term monitoring is important because glaucoma can develop or progress after the inflammation appears to resolve.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care if you experience sudden vision loss, severe eye pain, marked worsening of vision, new floaters or flashes, intense photophobia, or a rapid rise in eye pressure (symptoms such as severe headache with eye pain or nausea/vomiting). If instructed by your provider, stop any topical medications only as directed and present promptly to the emergency department or eye clinic for urgent assessment and treatment.


CASE 25 — Primary Congenital Glaucoma
=====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: cloudy eyes and tearing for 3 to 4 weeks (photophobia)
DURATION: 3 to 4 weeks
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "cloudy eyes and tearing"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 3-month-old female infant referred for 3–4 weeks of bilateral “cloudy eyes and tearing,” with photophobia and preference for dim light; symptoms noted by mother, no birth trauma, full-term uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, no family history of glaucoma; office exam showed diffuse corneal haze (R> L), corneal diameters ~12 mm OD and 11 mm OS, and IOP by iCare 45 mm Hg OD and 36 mm Hg OS while nursing.
History Narrative: A 3-month-old female infant was referred after her mother noted “cloudy eyes and tearing” for 3 to 4 weeks. The child was the product of a full-term uneventful pregnancy and delivery with no use of forceps. There was no known family history of glaucoma and she had a 3-year-old brother without any ocular problems. On examination in the office, the child was photophobic and was more comfortable in dim illumination. Both eyes had a diffuse corneal haze, the right more than the left. Estimated corneal diameters measured in the office were 12 mm in her right eye and 11 mm in her left eye. Intraocular pressure measurements were taken with iCare while the infant nursed on a bottle, and were 45 and 36 mm Hg for the right and left eyes, respectively.
Symptom Onset: 3 to 4 weeks before presentation
Symptom Duration: 3 to 4 weeks
Progression: Progressive
Characteristics: cloudy corneas, tearing (epiphora), photophobia, corneal enlargement/buphthalmos, diffuse corneal haze (right > left), elevated IOPs (45 mmHg OD, 36 mmHg OS), asymmetric bilateral involvement, infant female 3 months old, photophobic preferring dim illumination, Haab’s striae (Descemet’s breaks), increased corneal diameters (12 mm OD, 11 mm OS)


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Photophobia, corneal haze/edema, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) — increased IOP episodes (e.g., crying or facial compression during measurement)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 3-month-old female with 3–4 weeks of bilateral corneal clouding, tearing, and photophobia; right eye > left with corneal diameters 12 mm OD and 11 mm OS, IOP by iCare 45 mm Hg OD and 36 mm Hg OS. Findings and history are most consistent with primary congenital glaucoma (bilateral, asymmetric). Plan: place on topical/oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor pending clearance for general anesthesia and perform full examination under anesthesia with repeat IOP, corneal diameters, axial length, gonioscopy, and fundus evaluation; proceed with angle surgery (goniotomy or trabeculotomy, aiming for 360° treatment) at initial operative session if examination confirms diagnosis. Postop: topical cycloplegic and steroid 1–2 weeks; repeat EUA at 8–10 weeks and serial follow-up every 2–3 months until stable.
Primary Diagnosis: Primary congenital glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Primary congenital glaucoma; Peters anomaly/anterior segment dysgenesis; Congenital corneal endothelial dystrophy (e.g., CHED)/posterior polymorphous dystrophy; Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (if isolated epiphora)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: iCare (for IOP measurement) Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide) Topical beta‑blockers (selective; lower 0.25% dose in young children) Topical alpha‑2 agonists (not recommended/contraindicated in infants) Oral acetazolamide (5–10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours) Topical cycloplegics Topical corticosteroids (steroids) Mitomycin C (antimetabolite used adjunctively in trabeculectomy)
All Procedures: iCare IOP measurement; examination under anesthesia (including pressure measurement, corneal diameter measurement, ultrasonography/A-scan axial length, anterior segment exam, gonioscopy, dilated fundus exam and optic disc photos when not planning surgery); Tonopen/Perkins handheld applanation IOP measurement (in OR); topical medical therapy (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, selective beta-blockers); oral acetazolamide; goniotomy; trabeculotomy (360-degree angle treatment); glaucoma drainage device insertion (Baerveldt shunt); trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (rare); cyclodestructive procedures; postoperative topical cycloplegics and steroids; disc photography; intraoperative ultrasound when view obscured.
Follow-Up Instructions: Place on topical cycloplegic and steroid for 1–2 weeks. Perform second examination under anesthesia at 8–10 weeks postoperatively with repeat measurements; if IOP acceptable, dilate for disc photos and fundus exam. Repeat EUA every 2–3 months until IOP stable or office exam possible; then exam in clinic every 3–4 months, reducing to every 6 months when stable. By age 3–4 years, transition to office exams.
Patient Education: Explain that this is most consistent with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), a condition in infants caused by abnormal drainage of the eye leading to high pressure that can enlarge and cloud the cornea and damage the optic nerve. Emphasize that prompt surgery (angle surgery such as goniotomy or trabeculotomy) is the preferred, often curative treatment and is usually done at the time of the initial full exam under anesthesia. Explain preoperative medical therapy (topical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) is used temporarily to lower pressure and reduce corneal edema until surgery. Advise that general anesthesia and full exam (including IOP, corneal diameter, A-scan, gonioscopy, and possibly ultrasound) are required to confirm diagnosis and plan surgery. Discuss risks of untreated high IOP (vision loss, eye enlargement), typical postoperative care (short course of topical steroids and cycloplegics), and follow-up schedule (repeat exam/possible surgery at 8–10 weeks, then every 2–3 months until stable, later every 3–6 months). Warn about contraindicated medications in infants (alpha-2 agonists) and caution with beta-blockers; note need for pediatrician/anesthesiologist clearance. Encourage prompt treatment, provide reassurance about generally good success rates (80–90% with initial angle surgery), and recommend genetic/family counseling if concerned about inheritance.
Referrals: Pediatrician and anesthesiologist for clearance for general anesthesia; surgeon familiar with pediatric angle surgery (ophthalmic glaucoma surgeon)


CASE 26 — Ocular Hypotony
=========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: worsening vision
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 45-year-old woman with aphakic inflammatory glaucoma in the right eye (left eye light perception only from PHPV) presented preoperatively with vision 20/20 and IOP 40 mm Hg on maximum medical therapy; she underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy. Postoperatively IOP was 9–12 mm Hg for the first year, then 1 year after surgery she developed worsening vision to 20/60 (improving to 20/20 with +1.50 D), with a highly elevated avascular cystic bleb, moderate chorioretinal folds at the posterior pole and macula, and an IOP of 3 mm Hg.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old woman was referred for surgical management of inflammatory glaucoma in her aphakic right eye. Her left eye had had only light perception since birth due to persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. The preoperative visual acuity with aphakic correction was 20/20. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 40 mm Hg on maximum medical therapy including oral agents. Central corneal thickness was 535 μm in each eye. There was 1+ cell and flare in the anterior chamber with scattered, fine, keratic precipitates. There was vitreous at the pupillary plane. The optic disc was markedly excavated with a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.9 and a notch inferiorly. The visual field had a superior altitudinal defect. A trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy was performed without incident. Postoperatively, the visual acuity remained 20/20. The IOP was well controlled in the range of 9 to 12 mm Hg for the first postoperative year. However, 1 year after surgery, the patient presented with a complaint of worsening vision. The visual acuity was 20/60, which improved to 20/20 with an increase in hyperopic correction of +1.50 diopters. The bleb was highly elevated, avascular, and cystic. The remainder of the examination was unchanged from baseline except for moderate chorioretinal folds involving the posterior pole and macula. The IOP was 3 mm Hg. She was not taking any topical or systemic medications that could suppress aqueous production. Gonioscopy excluded a cyclodialysis cleft. There was no retinal or choroidal detachment. The axial length was 0.75 mm shorter and refraction 1.5 diopters more hyperopic than baseline readings. The eye was quiet and noninflamed.

CASE 27 — PosttrabeculectomyWound Leak
======================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Dramatic decrease in vision in the right eye
DURATION: 5 months
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 59-year-old woman with advanced primary open‑angle glaucoma who underwent a limbus‑based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye five months earlier, presenting with a dramatic decrease in vision in the right eye; on exam right eye best‑corrected visual acuity 20/100, very shallow anterior chamber, and intraocular pressure 2 mm Hg.
History Narrative: A 59-year-old woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma underwent a limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye. The scleral flap was closed with two 10–0 nylon sutures; Tenon’s capsule was closed with a running locking 8–0 Vicryl suture, and the conjunctiva was closed with a running nonlocking 8–0 dissolvable suture. Five months postoperatively she presented with a dramatic decrease in vision in the right eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/30 OS. The right anterior chamber was very shallow and intraocular pressure was 2 mm Hg.
Symptom Onset: Five months postoperatively
Symptom Duration: 5 months
Characteristics: Late bleb leak: cystic, thin-walled, avascular bleb associated with hypotony and shallow anterior chamber.


Subjective (cont.)

Primary Diagnosis: Late bleb leak
Differential Diagnosis: Late bleb leak; Chronic hypotony due to overfiltration; Choroidal effusion with hypotony
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: hypotony, shallow anterior chamber, hypotony maculopathy, choroidal effusion, cataract, corneal decompensation, synechiae, macular edema, blebitis, endophthalmitis


Plan
All Medications: mitomycin C 10–0 nylon 8–0 Vicryl topical corticosteroids topical aqueous suppressants systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors topical phenylephrine beta-blockers systemic corticosteroids
All Procedures: limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C; scleral flap closure with two 10–0 nylon sutures; Tenon’s capsule closure with running locking 8–0 Vicryl suture; conjunctival closure with running nonlocking 8–0 dissolvable suture; Seidel test; pressure patch; use of Simmons shell or oversized bandage contact lens; aqueous suppression; autologous blood injection into bleb/subconjunctival tissue; argon laser treatment; continuous-wave Nd:YAG laser treatment; excision of bleb with conjunctival advancement; bleb revision with autologous conjunctival graft; patch grafts (clear cornea, amniotic membrane, or scleral patch graft); Tenon’s capsule pedicle plug; glue; rotational conjunctival–Tenon’s flap graft; free conjunctival patching over ischemic blebs
Follow-Up Instructions: Once the leak is closed, follow closely for recurrent leaks if an ischemic bleb remains; if definitive surgical intervention was successful and the bleb is no longer ischemic, the risk of recurrence will be low.

Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shallow anterior chamber in the right eye 1 day after trabeculectomy
DURATION: 1 day
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 53-year-old woman with a history of bilateral chronic angle-closure glaucoma who presented 1 day after a mitomycin trabeculectomy with a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye. She had right eye vision decline to 20/400, IOP 34 mm Hg in the right eye (12 mm Hg left), a moderately elevated filtration bleb without leak, central and peripheral anterior chamber shallowing with iridocorneal contact to within 1 mm of the pupillary margin, a posterior chamber IOL 0.5 mm posterior to the corneal endothelium, 3+ anterior chamber cells, a patent surgical iridectomy with visible ciliary processes, poor view but excellent red reflex on funduscopy, and B-scan showing flat retina without choroidal effusions.
History Narrative: 53-year-old woman with bilateral chronic angle-closure glaucoma who developed a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye 1 day after mitomycin trabeculectomy. She reported decreased vision in the right eye; exam showed VA 20/400 OD, 20/40 OS, IOP 34 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. Right eye had a moderately elevated, Seidel-negative filtration bleb, central and peripheral anterior chamber shallowing with iridocorneal touch to within 1 mm of the pupil, a posterior chamber IOL situated 0.5 mm posterior to the corneal endothelium, and 3+ anterior chamber cells. A surgical peripheral iridectomy was present and patent with visible ciliary processes. Fundus view OD was poor but red reflex excellent; B-scan showed flat retina without choroidal effusions. Left eye had a filtration bleb, deep anterior chamber, patent iridectomy, and pseudophakia. Findings led to diagnosis of aqueous misdirection OD.
Symptom Onset: 1 day after trabeculectomy
Symptom Duration: 1 day
Progression: Stable
Characteristics: Central and peripheral shallowing of the anterior chamber with iridocorneal contact to within 1 mm of the pupil, flat (very shallow) central and peripheral anterior chamber, patent surgical iridectomy with visible anteriorly rotated ciliary processes, posterior chamber IOL 0.5 mm posterior to corneal endothelium, anterior chamber cells 3+, IOP elevated (34 mm Hg), no choroidal effusion on B-scan, bleb present and Seidel-negative


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: History of prior laser or incisional surgery, short axial length/predisposition to angle‑closure glaucoma, discontinuation of cycloplegics, use of miotics
Alleviating Factors: Cycloplegic–mydriatic therapy (e.g., atropine 1% ± phenylephrine 2.5%), topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, oral/IV osmotic agents, intracameral viscoelastic injection, Nd:YAG laser disruption of anterior hyaloid/posterior capsule, argon laser ciliary process shrinkage, and pars plana vitrectomy with anterior hyaloid removal.
Associated Symptoms: Shallow anterior chamber, decreased vision (20/400 OD), eye pain not described (no acute severe pain), anterior chamber cells 3+, patent iridectomy, history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma, elevated IOP OD (34 mm Hg)
Prior Treatments: mitomycin trabeculectomy
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — significant visual impairment in the right eye (20/400) likely limits depth perception and tasks requiring fine vision, but left eye (20/40) preserves some function, so daily activities partially impacted.
Risk Factors: Short axial length/angle‑closure glaucoma (history of chronic bilateral angle‑closure), prior intraocular surgery (trabeculectomy/laser or incisional surgery), pseudophakia, use of antimetabolites (mitomycin), postoperative inflammation and cycloplegic discontinuation risk

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Aqueous misdirection (ciliary block/malignant glaucoma) of the right eye presenting with central and peripheral shallowing of the anterior chamber after mitomycin trabeculectomy. Right eye: VA 20/400, IOP 34 mm Hg, patent surgical peripheral iridectomy with visible anteriorly rotated ciliary processes, pseudophakic posterior chamber IOL positioned 0.5 mm posterior to corneal endothelium, anterior chamber cells 3+, no bleb or wound leak (Seidel negative), no choroidal effusion or hemorrhage on fundus exam and B-scan. Findings and absence of alternative causes (no hypotony to suggest overfiltration; patent iridectomy excludes pupillary block; ultrasound/fundus negative for choroidals or hemorrhage) support the diagnosis of aqueous misdirection in the right eye. Recommend initial medical management with cycloplegic/mydriatic agents (atropine 1% ± phenylephrine), topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, consider osmotic agents and intracameral viscoelastic if lenticular–corneal touch with careful IOP monitoring; proceed to laser disruption of anterior hyaloid (Nd:YAG through pupil or iridectomy) or argon ciliary process ablation if medical therapy fails, and pars plana vitrectomy with anterior hyaloid removal and anterior chamber reformation if refractory. Maintain cycloplegia long-term as needed and counsel fellow eye on prophylactic iridotomy and avoidance of miotics.
Primary Diagnosis: Aqueous misdirection (malignant glaucoma)
Differential Diagnosis: Overfiltration with hypotony; Choroidal effusion; Pupillary block; Aqueous misdirection
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: Atropine 1% ophthalmic; Phenylephrine 2.5% ophthalmic; Topical aqueous suppressants (e.g., topical beta-blocker or alpha-agonist or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor); Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., acetazolamide); Oral or intravenous osmotic agent (e.g., oral glycerin or IV mannitol); Intracameral viscoelastic agent (e.g., sodium hyaluronate)
All Procedures: mitomycin trabeculectomy; surgical iridectomy (patent)
Follow-Up Instructions: Continue cycloplegia (eg, atropine 1% daily) — may need indefinite use; avoid miotics; monitor for recurrence, especially after stopping cycloplegia; in fellow eye consider prophylactic laser iridotomy and avoid miotics; arrange regular IOP and anterior chamber depth checks and retinal/ultrasound evaluation as needed; if medical/laser therapy fails, plan for vitrectomy.
Patient Education: Aqueous misdirection (also called ciliary block or malignant glaucoma) is a rare cause of a very shallow front chamber of the eye that can occur after glaucoma surgery. It happens when fluid is diverted backward into the vitreous, pushing the lens and iris forward, which can raise eye pressure and reduce vision. Treatment starts with medicines to relax the eye and reduce fluid production (cycloplegics like atropine, topical aqueous suppressants, and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), and may include osmotic agents or injection of viscoelastic to deepen the chamber. If medicines and laser treatments fail, a vitrectomy (removal of vitreous gel) to restore normal fluid flow may be needed. Avoid miotic drops (they can worsen the condition). If you have sudden vision change, pain, or significant shallowing of the eye after surgery, seek urgent ophthalmic care. Follow-up visits and possibly long-term use of cycloplegic drops may be required to prevent recurrence.


CASE 30 — Persistent Choroidal Detachment
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: shadow blocking her temporal vision
DURATION: 8 months
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "shadow"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: An 80-year-old woman with a 20-year history of glaucoma presented 8 months after combined cataract extraction, intraocular lens implant, and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye complaining of a persistent “shadow” blocking her temporal vision since surgery; vision worsening was severe enough to nearly cause a motor vehicle accident.
History Narrative: An 80-year-old woman with a 20-year history of glaucoma presented for consultation 8 months following combined cataract extraction, intraocular lens implant, and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye. She complained of a “shadow” since her surgery, which was blocking her temporal vision. This was so debilitating that she almost ran over a small boy with her car. The visual acuity was 20/30 in the affected eye and the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 7 mm Hg. A large, ischemic filtering bleb was present with a negative Seidel’s test. The cornea was clear, the anterior chamber deep and quiet, and the cup-to-disc ratio was 0.8. The peripheral fundus was not visible due to a small and fibrotic pupil. A B-scan ultrasound was performed, which showed 360-degree ciliochoroidal detachments with serous fluid inside the detachments. There was a large nasal choroidal detachment that measured 8 mm. There was no retinal detachment overlying the choroidal detachment.
Symptom Onset: 8 months after surgery
Symptom Duration: 8 months
Progression: Persistent
Characteristics: Serous, smooth, orange, bullous, 360-degree ciliochoroidal detachments with echographically clear suprachoroidal fluid; large nasal detachment measuring 8 mm; nonhemorrhagic (serous) and ischemic filtering bleb associated.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Overfiltration from trabeculectomy with mitomycin C leading to postoperative hypotony and a large ischemic bleb (low IOP), plus possibly topical/systemic aqueous suppressants and continued contralateral beta‑blocker use.
Alleviating Factors: Observation; elevation of IOP (e.g., reforming anterior chamber, stopping aqueous suppressants, discontinuing systemic CAIs and topical beta-blocker in fellow eye); topical steroids and cycloplegics; drainage surgery if vision blocked or persistent
Associated Symptoms: shadow blocking temporal vision; decreased vision (20/30); difficulty driving; hypotony-related symptoms (low IOP 7 mm Hg)
Prior Treatments: combined cataract extraction, intraocular lens implant, and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (right eye)
Impact on Daily Activities: Severely impaired — shadow blocking temporal vision causing near miss of hitting a child while driving
Risk Factors: - Glaucoma filtration surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy with mitomycin C) - Postoperative hypotony / overfiltration - Large or ischemic filtering bleb - Late bleb leak - Use of topical/systemic aqueous suppressants (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, topical beta‑blockers) - Recent cataract surgery (combined procedures) - Intraocular inflammation (iridocyclitis) - Cyclodialysis cleft - Advanced age

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Persistent serous choroidal detachment following combined cataract extraction, IOL implantation, and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Presentation 8 months postoperatively with a temporal visual “shadow,” visual acuity 20/30 and IOP 7 mm Hg. Exam notable for large ischemic filtering bleb (Seidel negative), deep quiet anterior chamber, small fibrotic pupil limiting peripheral fundus view. B-scan ultrasound: 360° ciliochoroidal detachments with serous fluid and a large nasal choroidal detachment measuring 8 mm; no overlying retinal detachment. Likely due to postoperative hypotony/overfiltration; differential includes bleb leak (Seidel negative), cyclodialysis cleft less likely without gonioscopic evidence, and suprachoroidal hemorrhage unlikely given serous appearance and low IOP without pain. Condition is persistent and symptomatic, causing visual axis obstruction and functional impairment. Surgical drainage indicated if nonresolving or vision remains affected; conservative measures (observation, stop aqueous suppressants, consider topical steroid and cycloplegic) may be attempted but intervention warranted given prolonged symptoms.
Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: Persistent serous choroidal detachment
Secondary Diagnoses: Glaucoma (20‑year history); Ischemic filtering bleb; Hypotony (IOP 7 mm Hg); Small fibrotic pupil; Pseudophakia (right eye after cataract extraction with IOL)
Differential Diagnosis: Overfiltration/functional hypotony; Filtering bleb leak; Serous choroidal effusion; Suprachoroidal hemorrhage
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: choroidal effusion; suprachoroidal hemorrhage; retinal detachment; bleb leak; cyclodialysis cleft; iridocyclitis; hypotony; corneal, retinal, or choroidal folds; lenticulocorneal touch; blocking of the visual axis; failing filtering bleb; overlying serous retinal detachment; persistent effusion; "kissing" choroidal detachments


Plan
All Medications: mitomycin C; systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (discontinue recommended; e.g., oral acetazolamide mentioned); topical aqueous suppressants (discontinue recommended); topical beta‑blocker (discontinue in contralateral eye recommended); topical steroid; topical cycloplegic; topical antibiotic; balanced salt solution (BSS) and viscoelastic (used intraoperatively)
All Procedures: combined cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C; B-scan ultrasound; paracentesis with anterior chamber reformation (BSS or viscoelastic) and anterior chamber maintainer placement; radial conjunctival incision and inferior sclerostomy with suprachoroidal drainage and sclerostomy punching; conjunctival closure with absorbable suture; subconjunctival antibiotic and steroid injection
Follow-Up Instructions: Examine 1 day postoperatively; place on brief course of topical steroid, antibiotic, and cycloplegic (if phakic); monitor for persistent effusion/drainage and expect prompt resolution with dramatic visual recovery if visual axis was involved.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: This 58-year-old man with 20 years of type I diabetes presents with bilateral clinically significant, center-involving diabetic macular edema (ci-CSME) confirmed by clinical exam, fluorescein angiography, and OCT. Right eye (OD) shows circinate lipid ring and persistent center-involving edema with visual acuity 20/30; left eye (OS) has similar macular edema but early neovascularization at the disc (NVD) and OCT-confirmed macular edema with visual acuity 20/20. No afferent pupillary defect; trace nuclear sclerosis; IOP 20 OU. Diagnosis: ci-CSME OU with early proliferative diabetic retinopathy OS. Initial management with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections OU was undertaken; after two injections, OS demonstrated resolution of edema and normal OCT/macula and required no further treatment, while OD had unresolved edema prompting a third anti-VEGF injection and focal laser to the macula. Systemic factors (recent hypertension, chronic hypercholesterolemia) may worsen response; recommend optimization of systemic control and close follow-up in 4–6 weeks with consideration of additional anti-VEGF series, switching agents if poor response after three injections, adjunctive/focal laser for OD as performed, and deferral of PRP unless progression of proliferative disease OS. Consider intravitreal corticosteroid or surgical intervention only for refractory cases or tractional components on OCT.
Primary Diagnosis: Clinically significant diabetic macular edema, center-involving (ci‑CSME) OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Type I diabetes mellitus (20-year history); hypertension (recent-onset); chronic hypercholesterolemia; early proliferative diabetic retinopathy OS; trace nuclear sclerotic lens opacity (trace nuclear cataract)
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic macular edema (DME); Hypertensive retinopathy with macular edema; Cystoid macular edema (postoperative or inflammatory); Radiation retinopathy
Severity: Clinically significant diabetic macular edema, center-involving (ci-CSME) OU
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, intravitreal corticosteroids, argon laser
All Procedures: intravitreal anti-VEGF injections OU; focal laser treatment OD; planned repeat anti-VEGF injections and follow-up examinations; (scheduled evaluation for possible PRP deferred)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in 4–6 weeks for clinical and OCT re‑evaluation; retreat with anti‑VEGF if persistent center‑involving edema. Consider a series of three same‑agent injections at 4–6 week intervals before switching; if poor response after three, consider switching anti‑VEGF or intravitreal corticosteroid (if pseudophakic and no IOP history). Repeat focal/grid laser can be considered at 3–6 months. Monitor for progression of proliferative disease (treat PRP if indicated) and optimize systemic control.
Patient Education: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is swelling of the central retina from long‑standing diabetes that can reduce vision. Treatment options include intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections (first‑line for center‑involving DME), focal/grid laser (more for non–center‑involving DME or adjunctive use), and occasionally intravitreal steroids or surgery for select cases with traction. Good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol improves outcomes. OCT imaging is used to monitor response; follow‑up typically every 4–6 weeks after treatment. Expect a series of injections (often 3 initially) with retreatment as needed; switching drugs or adding laser/steroid may be considered for persistent edema. Prompt evaluation is important if vision worsens.
Referrals: Medical consultation for optimization of systemic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.


CASE 33 — Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
============================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Second opinion regarding possible diabetic retinopathy (asymptomatic)
DURATION: 5 years
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 50-year-old man with a 5-year history of type II diabetes mellitus, asymptomatic at presentation, referred for second opinion regarding possible diabetic retinopathy.
History Narrative: A 50-year-old man with a 5-year history of type II diabetes mellitus presented for a second opinion regarding possible diabetic retinopathy. He was asymptomatic on initial presentation. Visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. Intraocular pressures were 12 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS. Slit-lamp exam and lenses were unremarkable and clear. Fundus exam OD showed mild hard exudates at the posterior pole without definite macular thickening, questionable neovascularization elsewhere at the distal portions of both temporal arcades, and definite neovascularization of the disc exceeding one disc area in extent. Fundus exam OS showed intraretinal hemorrhages with microaneurysms in all four quadrants with a moderate degree of hemorrhage limited to two quadrants, occasional hard exudates, and no intraretinal microvascular abnormalities or venous beading. No vitreous hemorrhage was present.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy with high‑risk characteristics — neovascularization of the disc exceeding one disc area, elevated neovascular fronds; no vitreous hemorrhage. Left eye: Moderately severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy — intraretinal hemorrhages and microaneurysms in multiple quadrants (moderate hemorrhage in two quadrants), occasional hard exudates, no intraretinal microvascular abnormalities or venous beading. Visual acuity 20/20 OU; IOPs 12 OD, 13 OS. No cataract or other anterior segment pathology. Recommend prompt panretinal photocoagulation for the right eye (consider staging and possible retrobulbar anesthesia), monitor left eye with routine diabetic retinopathy follow‑up and treat macular edema if present; consider adjunctive anti‑VEGF therapy if macular edema or if vitreous hemorrhage limits laser.
Primary Diagnosis: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (right eye)
Secondary Diagnoses: Type II diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy (proliferative vs nonproliferative); Retinal neovascularization from vein occlusion (branch/central retinal vein occlusion with collaterals); Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy; Radiation retinopathy
Severity: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy with high-risk characteristics
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Pain in the immediate posttreatment period - Vitreous hemorrhage - Decreased night vision / diminished illumination perception - Peripheral visual field loss - Exacerbation of diabetic macular edema - Early persistent visual loss (≥2 lines)


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe within a few weeks after completion of PRP; if retinopathy progresses consider vitrectomy; if retinopathy regresses completely pursue conservative observational follow-up based on stability of retinopathy and visual acuity; consider follow-up PRP and/or anti-VEGF for recurrent vitreous hemorrhages or incomplete regression of neovascularization.
Patient Education: You have diabetic eye disease. The right eye has proliferative diabetic retinopathy (abnormal new blood vessels at the optic disc) which can cause bleeding and vision loss; the left eye has moderately severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Treatment options include panretinal photocoagulation (laser) to reduce risk of severe vision loss and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections especially if there is macular swelling or vitreous hemorrhage; vitrectomy is reserved for persistent vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment. Good blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol control reduce progression. You should have regular dilated eye exams, promptly report new floaters, sudden vision loss, or worsening vision, and follow recommended treatment and follow-up schedules to preserve vision.


CASE 34 — Retinal Arterial Occlusion
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: sudden visual loss in the right eye 4 weeks prior
DURATION: 4 weeks
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 69-year-old woman who presented 4 weeks after sudden visual loss in the right eye; medical history notable for 6 years of systemic hypertension and 1 year of diabetes mellitus. Examination at presentation: visual acuity 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS, no afferent pupillary defect, IOP 16 mm Hg OU; slit-lamp notable only for early nuclear sclerosis OU. Fundus OD showed inferotemporal retinal artery attenuated with a glistening yellow cholesterol (Hollenhorst) plaque at its proximal part and an area of superficial retinal whitening in the posterior pole along the obstructed artery’s distribution; fundus OS normal. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a corresponding filling defect in the inferior branch retinal artery distribution.
History Narrative: A 69-year-old woman with a 6-year history of systemic hypertension and a 1-year history of diabetes mellitus presented 4 weeks after sudden visual loss in the right eye. She reported acute onset vision loss in the right eye; there was no afferent pupillary defect. Visual acuity at examination was 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressures were 16 mm Hg OU. Slit-lamp exam showed early nuclear sclerosis bilaterally. Fundus exam of the right eye revealed an inferotemporal retinal artery that was sclerotic and attenuated with a glistening yellow cholesterol embolus (Hollenhorst plaque) at its proximal part and an area of superficial retinal whitening in the posterior pole along the distribution of the obstructed artery. The left fundus was normal. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a corresponding filling defect in the inferior branch retinal artery distribution.
Symptom Onset: 4 weeks prior to presentation
Symptom Duration: 4 weeks
Progression: Improved (partial recovery)
Characteristics: Sudden, dense loss of vision corresponding to a zone of retinal whitening and arterial attenuation, often with a Hollenhorst cholesterol plaque and delayed arterial filling on fluorescein angiography; retinal whitening is transient and may show inner retinal atrophy on OCT later.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), right eye — inferotemporal branch with Hollenhorst plaque; associated inner retinal ischemic whitening in posterior pole consistent with embolic BRAO. Systemic vascular risk factors: hypertension and diabetes mellitus; recommend systemic vascular workup (carotid evaluation, ECG/echocardiography) and close follow-up for neovascularization. Visual acuity relatively preserved (20/30 OD, 20/25 OS); monitor for recanalization and consider IOP-lowering/embolus-displacing maneuvers only if within acute window.
Primary Diagnosis: Branch retinal artery occlusion, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Systemic hypertension; Diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Branch retinal artery occlusion; Central retinal artery occlusion; Embolic retinal ischemia from carotid or cardiac sources
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Retinal neovascularization; iris neovascularization (rare after BRAO, up to 20% after CRAO); potential neovascular glaucoma; recurrent vascular events/stroke or myocardial infarction (systemic vascular morbidity)


Plan
All Medications: acetazolamide topical intraocular pressure–lowering drops calcium channel blockers
All Procedures: digital ocular massage (digital pressure on the globe), lowering intraocular pressure with intravenous acetazolamide, topical intraocular pressure–lowering drops, anterior chamber paracentesis, inhalation of carbogen (5% CO2/95% O2), retrobulbar or systemic calcium channel blockers, full-scatter panretinal photocoagulation, prism glasses (low vision aid)
Follow-Up Instructions: Monitor for subsequent neovascularization with scheduled follow-up exams; reinforce and coordinate systemic vascular risk management with the patient’s internist (carotid/cardiac evaluation as indicated).
Patient Education: Retinal arterial occlusion is a sudden blockage of an artery in the eye causing painless vision loss in part (branch) or all (central) of the visual field. It is often due to an embolus (cholesterol, platelet-fibrin, or calcific) or thrombosis and is commonly linked to vascular disease such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, carotid artery plaque, or heart rhythm/valve problems. Immediate eye evaluation is important; however, vision often does not fully recover. Early treatments attempted acutely (within hours) may include lowering eye pressure (medications, paracentesis), ocular massage, and inhaled carbogen, but none are reliably proven to restore vision. The most important step is systemic evaluation by your primary care doctor or cardiologist (blood pressure and diabetes control, carotid imaging, ECG/echocardiogram, and vascular risk reduction) because this event increases risk of stroke and heart disease. Follow-up eye exams are needed to monitor for complications such as retinal or iris neovascularization; if these develop, laser treatment may be recommended. Low-vision aids and rehabilitation services can help adapt to persistent visual field loss. If you experience new sudden vision loss, seek urgent care.
Referrals: Internist for systemic vascular workup (including carotid evaluation and cardiac evaluation)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: CRVO OD with secondary macular edema: 45‑year‑old pseudophakic woman on oral contraceptives presenting with 3 weeks of decreased vision OD. BCVA 20/100 OD with a right RAPD, IOP 12 mm Hg, extensive intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants with mild disc edema, no iris neovascularization, macular edema ~1 disc area on OCT. FA showed good peripheral perfusion with focal foveal leakage (non‑ischemic/partially perfused CRVO). Initial treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone resolved edema and improved VA to 20/30, with recurrent edema requiring repeat steroid and subsequently maintenance intravitreal bevacizumab q~3 months with stable OCT and VA 20/30. Systemic risk factor: oral contraceptives (hypertension absent); cessation recommended. Follow‑up recommended monthly for 6 months to monitor for neovascularization.
Primary Diagnosis: Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with secondary macular edema, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Macular edema; Pseudophakia OD; History of oral contraceptive use; Hypertension absent (noted)
Differential Diagnosis: Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO); Branch or hemiretinal vein occlusion; Diffuse diabetic retinopathy/radiation retinopathy; Subhyaloid/subretinal hemorrhage
Severity: Nonstrict/Nonischemic (moderate CRVO)
Laterality: OD
Complications: - Macular edema (recurrent) - Neovascularization of the anterior segment / Neovascular glaucoma (risk) - Vitreous hemorrhage - Visual loss (reduced visual acuity)


Plan
All Medications: oral contraceptives; intravitreal triamcinolone; intravitreal bevacizumab; aspirin (80 mg daily)
All Procedures: Intravitreal triamcinolone injection (OD) Intravitreal triamcinolone injection (OD) — second injection Intravitreal bevacizumab injections (OD) approximately every 3 months
Follow-Up Instructions: Monthly follow-up examinations for 6 months after diagnosis (longer if receiving injections), with continued monitoring thereafter and vigilance for decreased visual acuity suggesting conversion to nonperfusion.
Patient Education: Cessation of oral contraceptives recommended due to thrombosis risk; importance of controlling systemic risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes, smoking) and follow-up with your primary doctor. CRVO can cause vision loss mainly from macular edema and, less commonly, neovascular glaucoma—report any sudden vision changes or eye pain. Macular edema often improves with intravitreal treatments (anti-VEGF or corticosteroid injections); expect an initial series of injections then maintenance treatments guided by OCT. Regular ophthalmic follow-up monthly for the first 6 months (more often if receiving injections) to monitor vision, OCT, and for early signs of neovascularization; prompt laser (PRP) or additional therapy may be needed if neovascularization develops. Discuss risks and benefits of treatments (injection-related infection, cataract progression, eye pressure rise) and notify the clinic for pain, redness, floaters, or sudden vision loss.
Referrals: Referral to primary care physician/internist for systemic evaluation and management (including cessation of oral contraceptives)
Work Restrictions: Avoid heavy visual tasks and driving until visual acuity/stability confirmed; limit activities with fall/eye-injury risk; follow monthly ophthalmology visits for 6 months.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 66-year-old man with a 2-month history of decreased vision in the left eye characterized by a central scotoma centered superotemporally; history notable for a 20-year history of well-controlled hypertension. Visual acuity at presentation OS was 20/200; prior CRVO in the right eye treated with multiple anti-VEGF and intravitreal triamcinolone, with improvement OD from 20/400 to 20/80. Intravitreal bevacizumab initially given OS without improvement, then aflibercept every 6 weeks for ~1 year with stabilization of vision OS at 20/70. Intraocular pressures 15 mm Hg OU. Fundus exam OS showed anomalous arteriovenous crossing along the inferotemporal arcade with dot-and-blot hemorrhages extending from mid-inferotemporal arcade into the macula and moderate–marked macular edema.
History Narrative: A 66-year-old man with a 20-year history of well-controlled hypertension presented with a 2-month history of decreased vision in the left eye characterized by a central scotoma centered superatemporally. Visual acuity at first presentation was 20/200 OS. The right eye had a prior central retinal vein occlusion treated with multiple intravitreal anti-VEGF injections and a couple of intravitreal triamcinolone injections, improving VA OD from 20/400 to 20/80. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OU. Funduscopic exam OD showed a dry macula with collateral vessels at the optic nerve head. OS demonstrated an anomalous arteriovenous crossing along the inferotemporal arcade with dot-and-blot hemorrhages extending from the midportion of the inferotemporal arcade posteriorly into the macula and moderate to marked macular edema. A branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with macular edema was diagnosed OS. Initial intravitreal bevacizumab produced no improvement; subsequent intravitreal aflibercept given about every 6 weeks for ~1 year produced better effect with stabilization of vision at 20/70 OS.

Fundus Exam – Optic Nerve: Nerve head with collateral vessels at the optic nerve head (OD); no specific optic nerve abnormality noted OS.
Fundus Exam – Macula: moderate to marked macular edema with dot-and-blot hemorrhages extending into the macula; macular edema involving the fovea (OCT: substantial edema spreading into center)
Fundus Exam – Vessels: Anomalous arteriovenous crossing along the inferotemporal arcade with sectoral (inferotemporal) dot-and-blot hemorrhages and collateral vessels at the optic nerve head
Fundus Exam – Periphery: Normal peripheral retina without mention of peripheral lesions or retinal tears.


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: BRVO of the left eye with macular edema causing decreased vision OS (central scotoma), vision OS 20/70–20/200 at presentation (initially 20/200, stabilized at 20/70) despite intravitreal bevacizumab; improved response to intravitreal aflibercept with injections every 6 weeks for ~1 year controlling edema. Right eye with prior CRVO treated with multiple anti-VEGF and intravitreal triamcinolone, now dry macula and vision OD 20/80. Intraocular pressures 15 mm Hg OU. Left eye fundus: inferotemporal BRVO with dot-and-blot hemorrhages extending into macula, anomalous AV crossing along inferotemporal arcade, moderate–marked macular edema on OCT. No retinal neovascularization or vitreous hemorrhage noted. Plan: continue intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (aflibercept q6 weeks currently) with OCT monitoring; consider sectoral scatter laser only if neovascularization develops; inform primary care for systemic hypertension management and monitor for progression.
Primary Diagnosis: BRVO with macular edema, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension (well-controlled)
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy; Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO); Radiation retinopathy; Sickle cell retinopathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: Macular edema; retinal neovascularization; vitreous hemorrhage; fibrovascular proliferation leading to tractional/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; epiretinal membrane; decreased visual acuity resulting from these complications.


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab; aflibercept; intravitreal triamcinolone; aspirin
All Procedures: intravitreal bevacizumab injection; intravitreal aflibercept injections every 6 weeks; intravitreal triamcinolone injections (prior, OD); focal/grid laser photocoagulation; sectoral/scatter laser photocoagulation to affected quadrant; vitrectomy with membrane peeling (for epiretinal membrane or nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage/tractional detachment); optic nerve sheath decompression/lysis of common adventitial sheath (experimental)
Follow-Up Instructions: Patients with vision better than 20/32: follow every 3–6 months initially. For macular edema treated with intravitreal therapy: initiate injections every 4–6 weeks, then extend interval based on clinical response; switch agents if inadequate response. Perform segmental scatter photocoagulation if retinal neovascularization is detected. Vitrectomy for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or vision‑threatening tractional retinal detachment.
Patient Education: Explain that a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a blockage of a retinal vein causing bleeding and swelling in part of the retina, often leading to decreased central vision or a central scotoma. Reassure that BRVO is usually less severe than central retinal vein occlusion but can cause vision loss mainly from macular edema and, less commonly, from abnormal new vessels and vitreous hemorrhage. Emphasize controlling cardiovascular risk factors (especially blood pressure; notify/coordinate care with primary doctor) because hypertension and other vascular risks are associated. Describe the main treatments: intravitreal injections (anti-VEGF agents or steroids) are currently the primary therapy to reduce macular swelling and improve or stabilize vision; focal or sectoral laser may be used for persistent edema or to treat/prevent neovascularization; surgery (vitrectomy) is reserved for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment. Explain typical course: many patients require repeated injections at intervals (often initial every 4–6 weeks then extended as response allows); monitoring with vision checks and OCT imaging is needed to guide treatment. Advise symptoms that warrant prompt return: sudden new floaters, dark curtain, marked further vision loss, or severe pain. Discuss prognosis: some spontaneous improvement can occur, but timely treatment improves chances of vision recovery or stabilization. Encourage adherence to follow-up and treatment, report medication side effects (eye pain, redness, worsening vision), and ask about systemic anticoagulant or bleeding risks before injections.

PATIENT QUOTES: "Vision was stable per patient"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 68-year-old man presents for follow-up retina evaluation for bilateral nonexudative (atrophic) macular degeneration. Vision reported stable; no prior laser or intravitreal injections. He was instructed to continue AREDS2 vitamins and daily Amsler grid monitoring.
History Narrative: A 68-year-old man presented for follow-up retina evaluation for nonexudative macular degeneration in both eyes. Vision was stable per patient and the patient had no prior history of laser or intravitreal injections. Visual acuity was 20/50 on the right and 20/60 on the left. Pupil examination was normal and intraocular pressures were within normal limits in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination showed mild to moderate nuclear sclerotic lens opacities in both eyes. Funduscopic examination showed cup-to-disc ratios of 0.3 in the right eye and 0.5 in the left eye without glaucomatous atrophy. The macular examination was notable for marked retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmentation with drusen and central macular atrophy in both eyes. There was no subretinal or intraretinal fluid, blood, or exudate. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in both eyes and showed drusen and central RPE atrophy in both eyes with no evidence of macular fluid. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) showed central hypo-autofluorescence in both eyes. Observational follow-up was recommended; the patient was instructed to use the Amsler grid daily, continue AREDS2 vitamin supplementation, and maintain a diet with sufficient green, leafy vegetables.

CASE 39 — Myopic Degeneration
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 1-year history of visual loss in the right eye and 1-month history of distortion with a paracentral scotoma in the left eye
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "finding everything to be cloudy."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 38-year-old high myope (≈–10 D) urologist with 1-year history of visual loss in the right eye due to a diagnosed choroidal neovascular membrane; at presentation also 1 month of distortion with a paracentral scotoma in the left eye. Over ensuing 6 years left eye treated with laser and remained 20/20, then returned with a 1-month history of decreased central vision in the left eye described as everything appearing cloudy.
History Narrative: A 38-year-old urologist presented with a 1-year history of visual loss in the right eye; he had been told he had a choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) in the right eye that was not amenable to treatment. At presentation he had a 1-month history of distortion with a paracentral scotoma in his left eye. He was a high myope with a spherical equivalent of −10 D.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization and recurrence secondary to myopic degeneration, OU.
Primary Diagnosis: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization and recurrence secondary to myopic degeneration, OU
Secondary Diagnoses: - High myopia (spherical equivalent −10 D) - Glaucoma - Retinal lattice degeneration (OU) - Peripapillary retinal pigment epithelial atrophy
Differential Diagnosis: Pathologic myopia with choroidal neovascular membrane; Age-related macular degeneration with CNV; Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome with CNV; Traumatic choroidal rupture with secondary CNV
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OU
Complications: - Choroidal neovascularization (CNVM) with recurrent/progressive subretinal hemorrhage and retinal pigment epithelial atrophy leading to central vision loss - Macular scarring (Fuchs' spot) - Progressive myopic degeneration features: lacquer cracks, posterior staphyloma, tilted optic disc, peripapillary atrophy - Retinal lattice degeneration increasing risk of retinal detachment - Glaucoma (preexisting) - Potential complications from treatments: laser-induced RPE atrophy/scar, risks of intravitreal injections (endophthalmitis), and surgical risks if performed (retinal detachment)


Plan
All Medications: Propine (dipivefrin) OU; beta‑blocker OU; intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab, bevacizumab); verteporfin (for PDT)
All Procedures: argon blue-green laser treatment; krypton laser treatment; intravitreal anti-VEGF injections; photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT); laser photocoagulation; pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal CNVM excision; prophylactic laser or retinocryopexy (considered)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Follow-up 4 weeks after initial anti-VEGF treatment for myopic CNVM; interval may be extended based on response and stability. - Perform OCT at each visit to detect subclinical CNVM or macular schisis. - For nonexudative myopic degeneration, follow-up twice annually. - Patient to monitor central vision with an Amsler grid and seek prompt ophthalmologic evaluation for new distortion or central metamorphopsia.
Patient Education: - Monitor central vision daily with an Amsler grid and report any new distortion or central vision loss immediately. - Myopic degeneration can cause vision loss from atrophy or from choroidal neovascularization (CNV); CNV is treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (e.g., ranibizumab/bevacizumab). - Regular follow-up is important: for CNV, return 4 weeks after initial anti-VEGF treatment, then extend intervals based on response; nonexudative disease typically seen every 6 months. - OCT and fluorescein angiography are used to monitor for recurrent or new CNV and macular changes. - There is no proven treatment for atrophic myopic degeneration; low-vision aids (magnifiers, high-plus lenses, telescopes, closed-circuit video) and rehabilitation can help maximize function. - Protect eyes from additional risk (avoid eye trauma); discuss retinal detachment symptoms and seek urgent care if flashes, many new floaters, or curtain-like vision loss occur.


CASE 40 — Idiopathic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy
=====================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Blurriness in the left eye for 3 weeks
DURATION: 3 weeks
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I deny any past medical history, trauma, diabetes, hypertension, steroids, or previous surgeries."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 35-year-old engineer with 3 weeks of blurriness in the left eye, central metamorphopsia on Amsler grid, no pain; denies trauma, diabetes, hypertension, steroid use, past medical history, or prior surgeries.
History Narrative: A 35-year-old engineer presented with 3 weeks of blurriness in his left eye. He denied past medical history, trauma, diabetes, hypertension, steroid use, or prior surgeries. On exam visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, improving to 20/30 OS with +2.00 lens. Anterior segments and intraocular pressures were unremarkable bilaterally. Dilated fundus exam showed a normal right eye and an elevated, circumscribed neurosensory macular detachment in the left eye without retinal tears, hemorrhages, or exudates. The patient reported central metamorphopsia on Amsler grid testing of the left eye. OCT demonstrated subretinal fluid under the fovea OS, and fluorescein angiography of the left eye revealed an expanding area of leakage in the macula. The patient was observed; one month later the subretinal fluid resolved and vision returned to 20/20.
Symptom Onset: 3 weeks
Symptom Duration: 3 weeks
Progression: Resolved (subretinal fluid resolved and vision returned to 20/20 one month after observation)

Complications: scotomas; subretinal neovascularization; expansion of laser burns


Plan
All Medications: +2.00 lens; oral rifampin; methotrexate; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; metoprolol; propranolol; ketoconazole; mifepristone; eplerenone; spironolactone; finasteride; systemic corticosteroids (stopping advised); anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections (eg, anti-VEGF)
All Procedures: Observation/close follow-up (no procedural intervention)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe closely; return for follow-up exam with OCT and visual acuity monitoring within 4–12 weeks (or sooner if symptoms worsen). If subretinal fluid persists beyond ~3 months or vision/functionally impaired, consider treatment (PDT or focal laser) and referral for retinal specialist. Stop systemic corticosteroids if present. Return immediately for new pain, increasing vision loss, or metamorphopsia.
Patient Education: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a usually self‑limited condition where fluid collects under the central retina, causing blurry vision and distortion. Most cases improve on their own within 3 months; close observation with follow‑up visits and OCT imaging is standard. Avoid or stop systemic corticosteroids if possible and discuss any stress or medications that may contribute. If fluid persists or vision is significantly affected, treatments such as photodynamic therapy or focal laser may be recommended. Report any worsening vision, increased distortion, new flashes/floaters, or vision loss promptly. Follow‑up eye exams are needed to monitor for recurrence or contralateral involvement.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care if you experience sudden worsening of vision, new severe eye pain, flashes of light, a sudden increase in floaters, or signs of infection (redness, discharge, fever).


CASE 41 — Epiretinal Membrane
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressively decreasing vision in the right eye for 18 months with metamorphopsia
DURATION: 18 months
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I've had progressively decreasing vision in my right eye for about 18 months."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 73-year-old woman with an 18-month history of progressively decreasing vision in the right eye, associated metamorphopsia; prior right retinal detachment repaired with pars plana vitrectomy, endolaser, and gas 2 years earlier; presenting best corrected visual acuity 20/200.
History Narrative: A 73-year-old woman presented with an 18-month history of progressively decreasing vision in the right eye, with metamorphopsia and best corrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/200.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: ERM secondary to prior peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment in the right eye, presenting with 18 months of progressive visual decline and metamorphopsia. Exam and OCT demonstrate a prominent epiretinal membrane with foveal contour distortion and increased foveal thickness causing best corrected visual acuity 20/200. Given symptomatic visual impairment and OCT findings, patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with ERM peel (± ILM peel). At 3 months postoperatively visual acuity improved to 20/60 with marked reduction in metamorphopsia and no clinical or OCT evidence of recurrent ERM; foveal thickness decreased and contour improved.
Primary Diagnosis: ERM secondary to previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Retinal detachment (repaired)
Differential Diagnosis: Cystoid macular edema; Vitreomacular traction; Hypotony/hypotony-induced choroidal folds (retinopathy)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Retinal detachment; progressive nuclear sclerosis/cataract formation


Plan
All Medications: Topical corticosteroid drops; topical antibiotic drops
All Procedures: Pars plana vitrectomy; Endolaser; Gas tamponade; Vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel (ERM peel); Internal limiting membrane peel (often performed with ERM removal)
Follow-Up Instructions: Topical corticosteroid and antibiotic eye drops postoperatively; routine follow-up to monitor visual acuity and OCT (visual improvement most rapid over first 6 weeks, maximal by 3–6 months); monitor for complications (retinal detachment, cataract) and consider cataract surgery if progressive nuclear sclerosis develops.
Patient Education: An epiretinal membrane (ERM) is a thin layer of tissue that forms on the surface of the retina and can cause blurred vision and visual distortion (metamorphopsia). It is commonly diagnosed by eye exam and optical coherence tomography (OCT). If vision and symptoms are mild, careful observation is appropriate because ERMs often stabilize. Surgery (vitrectomy with membrane peel, sometimes with internal limiting membrane peel) is recommended if vision worsens to about 20/40–20/60 or if distortion is severe; most patients experience visual improvement over 3–6 months after surgery. There is no effective medication to remove the membrane. After surgery you will use steroid and antibiotic eye drops, vision usually improves most rapidly in the first 6 weeks and continues up to 3–6 months, and cataract progression is common after vitrectomy. Risks of surgery are low but include retinal detachment; recurrence of ERM is uncommon. Follow-up exams and OCT are used to monitor status.


CASE 42 — Vitreomacular Traction
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye for 3 months, interfering with driving and reading
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have had progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in my right eye for 3 months; it's interfering with my driving and reading."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 78-year-old woman with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye, interfering with driving and reading.
History Narrative: A 78-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye interfering with driving and reading abilities. The vision was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated clear cornea, absence of cataract, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Fundoscopic examination showed focal areas of adherent posterior vitreous to the macula associated with raised retinal tissue, OD, and a nonspecific loss of foveal reflex, OS. Optical coherence tomography in OD demonstrated a hyperreflective layer correspondent to the posterior hyaloid partially attached to the macula, leading to elevation and distortion of the retina. The OCT OS also showed focal vitreomacular attachment with distortion of the inner foveal layers. An intravitreal ocriplasmin injection was performed OD without improvement in vision or OCT appearance after 1 month. A pars plana vitrectomy was performed OD with release of the vitreomacular traction and improvement of the foveal contour. The vision was 20/30 OD 1 month postoperatively. The OS has remained unchanged with vision of 20/40 without clinically important or progressive symptoms, so it has been observed.
Symptom Onset: 3 months

=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden decreased vision in the left eye for 3 months
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 90-year-old woman with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye.
History Narrative: This 90-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye. Past ocular history included vision of 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS three years earlier due to atrophic age-related macular degeneration OD and a previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane OS.

Pupils – Other: afferent pupillary defect absent
Extraocular Movements: Full and painless in both eyes
Slit Lamp Exam Description: Slit-lamp examination showed a well-positioned posterior chamber lens implant on the right; in the left eye, 2+ nuclear sclerosis; vitreous adherent to the wound superiorly.
Fundus Exam – Macula: subfoveal laser scar with contiguous subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the midperiphery
Fundus Exam – Periphery: Dense vitreous hemorrhage precluding posterior view; on follow-up, subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the midperiphery with contiguous subfoveal laser scar; no retinal tear or detachment on B-scan; peripheral retina intact to ora serrata on examination.


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Vitreous hemorrhage OS most consistent with breakthrough bleeding from subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to previously treated age-related macular degeneration. B-scan ultrasound demonstrated vitreous hemorrhage with posterior vitreous detachment OS without evidence of retinal tear or detachment. Visual acuity OS 2/200 (improving to 20/400 on follow-up) with limited visual potential (≈20/200) and good fellow-eye vision; no diabetes or hypertensive proliferative retinopathy suspected. Plan: observation with close follow-up given lack of tear/detachment and limited surgical benefit at this time; consider vitrectomy only if hemorrhage fails to clear by 3–6 months or if bilateral vision threatened.
Primary Diagnosis: Vitreous hemorrhage due to breakthrough bleeding associated with choroidal neovascularization, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Posterior vitreous detachment; Atrophic age-related macular degeneration OD; Previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane OS; Pseudophakia OD; Nuclear sclerosis OS
Differential Diagnosis: Breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage from choroidal neovascularization (AMD); Posterior vitreous detachment with retinal tear; Proliferative retinopathies (e.g., proliferative diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusion); Vitreous opacities from posterior uveitis/pars planitis
Severity: Very severe
Laterality: OS


Plan
All Procedures: B-scan/A-scan ultrasonography; Indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression; Laser photocoagulation; Diagnostic vitrectomy; Pars plana vitrectomy (vitrectomy) including possible scleral buckling and other vitreoretinal surgical maneuvers; Positioning (sleeping in an inclined position)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observed with close follow-up; monitor for spontaneous clearing and visual improvement with repeat evaluation (including dilated exam and B‑scan as needed); if no clearing within 3–6 months consider vitrectomy (earlier—2–6 months—in proliferative disease); counsel re expectations and consider surgery sooner if bilateral loss or signs of retinal tear/detachment.
Patient Education: You have bleeding into the gel (vitreous) inside your eye, most likely from abnormal blood vessels under the retina related to your previously treated macular degeneration. This can cause sudden vision loss but sometimes clears on its own over weeks to months. Key points: - We’ll monitor you closely with exams and ultrasound to make sure there is no retinal tear or detachment that needs urgent treatment. - There is no medicine that reliably speeds clearing of vitreous blood; positioning (sleeping slightly upright) may let the blood settle so we can examine the eye better but won’t hasten recovery. - If the blood does not clear over 3–6 months or if a treatable cause (like proliferative disease or a retinal tear) is found, a vitrectomy (surgical removal of the blood) may be recommended; timing depends on visual potential and underlying disease. - If you notice worsening vision, new flashes, a shadow or curtain over your vision, increasing pain, or other sudden changes, contact us immediately. - Keep routine follow-up appointments and bring any changes in vision to care promptly; the goal is to preserve remaining vision and treat any treatable cause.


CASE 44 — Retinitis Pigmentosa
==============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressive difficulty seeing at night (nyctalopia) and decreased peripheral vision.
DURATION: 14 years
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "clumsy"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 24-year-old woman with progressive night vision difficulties since age 10, long-standing nyctalopia and clumsiness bumping into objects, stopped driving at night one year ago because unsafe; otherwise healthy, no family history of ocular problems, no consanguinity.
History Narrative: A 24-year-old woman with progressive visual difficulties at night was evaluated. Since the age of 10, she has had trouble performing outdoor activities after dusk. A year ago she stopped driving at night because she no longer felt safe. For many years she has been “clumsy” and often walked into surrounding objects she could not see well. She was otherwise healthy. Family history was negative for ocular problems, and there was no consanguinity.
Symptom Onset: 10 years
Symptom Duration: 14 years
Progression: Gradual progressive visual loss over years with moderately advanced disease progression
Characteristics: Progressive rod and cone photoreceptor dysfunction and death leading to nyctalopia, progressive peripheral visual field loss, midperipheral retinal atrophy with bone‑spicule pigment clumping and vascular attenuation; central vision relatively spared until late; often sporadic/genetically heterogeneous.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Reduced retinal exposure to bright light / sun exposure (phototoxic UV/visible light)
Alleviating Factors: Wearing sunglasses to reduce retinal exposure to UV light; low-vision aids; treatment of cystoid macular edema (e.g., oral acetazolamide); cataract extraction when cataract develops; retinal implant for very advanced disease; oral vitamin A/lutein/DHA supplements (controversial).
Associated Symptoms: Progressive night vision difficulties (nyctalopia), clumsiness with bumping into objects, progressive loss of peripheral vision (midperipheral ring scotomas)
Impact on Daily Activities: Stopped driving at night; clumsy and often walked into objects; difficulty with outdoor activities after dusk — significant limitation in night-time mobility and driving.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Recent Travel: No recent travel
Risk Factors: Genetic inheritance (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked) and positive family history; sporadic cases (~50%); consanguinity increases risk; certain gene mutations (e.g., ABCA4)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 44-year-old woman with progressive nyctalopia and peripheral vision loss since childhood. Best-corrected visual acuity 20/25 OU, no RAPD. Goldmann fields show large midperipheral ring-shaped scotomas OU. Fundus: midperipheral and peripheral retinal atrophy with pigment clumping (“bone spicules”) and retinal vascular attenuation. Full-field ERG: nondetectable rod and cone responses. Family history negative. Diagnosis: retinitis pigmentosa, sporadic, moderately advanced. Recommend genetic testing to determine genotype and inheritance, consider OCT to evaluate for CME or macular atrophy, counseling regarding prognosis, sun protection, low vision rehabilitation as needed; discuss potential risks/benefits of vitamin A/DHA/lutein and consider referral for clinical trials or retinal implant evaluation if vision declines.
Primary Diagnosis: Retinitis pigmentosa, sporadic, moderately advanced
Differential Diagnosis: Retinitis pigmentosa; Choroideremia; Gyrate atrophy; Vitamin A deficiency
Severity: moderately advanced
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: cystoid macular edema; posterior subcapsular cataract; optic nerve atrophy; vitreous syneresis; mild vitritis; progressive visual field loss leading to severe vision loss (including bare light perception/no light perception)


Plan
All Medications: vitamin A palmitate 15,000 IU daily; vitamin E (oral); lutein (oral); docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, oral); acetazolamide (oral); dorzolamide (topical)
All Procedures: Goldmann visual field testing Funduscopic examination Full-field electroretinography (ERG) Optical coherence tomography (OCT) Automated 30-degree visual field testing Automated kinetic visual field testing Genetic testing Retinal implant surgery Oral vitamin A therapy (medication) Oral lutein and DHA supplementation (medication) Oral acetazolamide therapy (medication) Topical dorzolamide (medication) Cataract extraction (phacoemulsification) Laser posterior capsulotomy Low vision rehabilitation/low vision aids Periodic liver function testing
Follow-Up Instructions: If cataract or CME develops, consider treatment; monitor yearly and provide periodic follow-up for vision, OCT if decreased acuity to assess CME, and counseling/low-vision referral as needed.
Patient Education: - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited, progressive retinal degeneration causing night blindness and loss of peripheral vision; central vision is often preserved until late. - The disease is genetically heterogeneous; genetic testing can clarify inheritance, rule out syndromic forms, and enable trial eligibility. - Regular monitoring includes visual fields, OCT (to detect cystoid macular edema), and electroretinography as indicated. - Treatable complications: cystoid macular edema (may respond to oral acetazolamide), posterior subcapsular cataract (surgery may be needed), and low-vision rehabilitation. - Sunglasses to reduce retinal UV exposure are recommended. - Supplements (vitamin A palmitate, DHA, lutein) have uncertain benefit and potential genotype-specific harm (e.g., vitamin A may be harmful in ABCA4-related disease); discuss risks and benefits and consider genetic testing before starting supplements. - For very advanced disease (bare light perception or worse), retinal implants may offer rudimentary vision. - Counsel about variable prognosis, family counseling/genetic counseling, and available clinical trials.
Referrals: Genetic counseling/testing referral; low-vision rehabilitation services; retina specialist (for monitoring/treatment of CME, consideration of retinal implant in advanced disease)


CASE 45 — Choroiditis

Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: constant pain in the right eye for 3 weeks, blurred vision, redness, and tearing for 1 week
DURATION: 1 month
LATERALITY: Initially right eye, later became bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have constant pain in my right eye for 3 weeks, blurred vision, redness, and tearing for 1 week, and I've had a headache and stiff neck for a month."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 24-year-old Hispanic woman with 1-month history of headache and neck stiffness and 2-day prodromal flu‑like symptoms, who developed constant right eye pain for 3 weeks, and 1 week of blurred vision, redness, and tearing. No history of trauma. Lumbar puncture showed mild pleocytosis; initial visual acuity 20/20 OU but later right vision decreased to 3/200 with persistent pain and bilateral anterior chamber inflammation and right vitreous cells, optic disc edema, serous retinal detachments and focal RPE lesions.
History Narrative: A 24-year-old Hispanic woman complained of constant pain in the right eye for 3 weeks, blurred vision, redness, and tearing for 1 week, and a 1-month history of headache and neck stiffness. She had a 2-day history of flu-like symptoms prior to presentation and denied any history of trauma. CT of the brain was normal. Lumbar puncture showed a mild pleocytosis. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU. IOP was 18 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Slit-lamp exam disclosed moderate anterior chamber cell and flare OD with granulomatous keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium; a mild anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was noted OS. Vitreous cells were present OD. Fundus exam OD showed optic disc edema with focal areas of serous retinal detachment and folding of the retina within the macular region; the left eye was unremarkable. B-scan ultrasonography OD showed diffuse choroidal thickening with low reflectivity and a shallow serous macular detachment. She was started on topical prednisolone acetate 1% and cycloplegics. One week later she returned with persistent pain and markedly decreased visual acuity OD to 3/200. The anterior chamber reaction had decreased slightly OD, while OS had increased cell and flare with a few keratic precipitates. Fundus exam showed increased optic disc edema, subretinal fluid and retinal folds, and focal yellow-white lesions at the level of the RPE in the macula OD. Vision was 20/25 OS with a new focal area of subretinal fluid in the nasal macula. Fluorescein angiography OD demonstrated multiple areas of pinpoint hyperfluorescence in the juxtapapillary region and macula that leaked in the later frames; a similar angiographic appearance was noted adjacent to the optic disc OS.
Symptom Onset: 3 weeks (constant right eye pain), with blurred vision/redness/tearing for 1 week, and headache/neck stiffness for 1 month
Symptom Duration: 3 weeks
Progression: Worsening — progressed from unilateral mild inflammation with serous detachments to bilateral involvement with increased optic disc edema and marked vision loss in right eye (20/20 → 3/200) over one week

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 24-year-old Hispanic woman with bilateral granulomatous panuveitis, optic disc edema, multifocal serous retinal detachments, pinpoint RPE hyperfluorescence on FA, diffuse low-reflectivity choroidal thickening on B-scan, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis. No history of ocular trauma. Presentation, demographics, neurological signs, bilateral posterior segment involvement and imaging are most consistent with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome.
Primary Diagnosis: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome
Differential Diagnosis: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome; sympathetic ophthalmia; sarcoidosis; infectious choroiditis (e.g., tuberculosis, syphilis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: posterior synechiae; angle-closure glaucoma; cataract formation; choroidal neovascularization


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (topical), cycloplegics, oral prednisone (systemic corticosteroids 80–200 mg/day), ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, intravenous steroids (for severe cases), cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, azathioprine
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow frequently in the initial stages to adjust systemic corticosteroids for control of inflammation and prevention of sequelae; once inflammation and exudative detachment decrease, taper steroids gradually with less frequent exams; if steroids inadequate or intolerable, consider steroid-sparing immunosuppressants and monitor regularly for cataract, choroidal neovascularization, and angle‑closure glaucoma.
Patient Education: You have Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome, an inflammatory condition that affects the eye and can cause vision loss if not treated promptly. Key points: - Treatment: High‑dose oral corticosteroids (often tapered slowly over 4–6 months) are required to control inflammation; sometimes intravenous steroids or other immunosuppressive medicines are used if needed. - Purpose: Early, aggressive treatment reduces swelling, resolves serous retinal detachments, and lowers the risk of permanent vision loss. - Eye care: Use prescribed topical steroid eye drops and cycloplegic drops as directed; attend frequent follow‑up visits initially so your doctor can adjust medications based on inflammation and vision. - Side‑effect prevention: Take stomach protection (e.g., ranitidine or other agent) while on high‑dose steroids and report any severe side effects (mood changes, high blood sugar, new infections, weight gain). - Symptoms to report urgently: sudden vision loss, increasing pain, redness, flashes/floaters, severe headache, hearing changes, or new skin/hair changes (vitiligo, hair loss). - Long‑term: Slow tapering of steroids over months reduces relapse risk; if steroids are insufficient or cause intolerable side effects, steroid‑sparing immunosuppressants may be recommended. - Monitoring: Regular eye exams to watch for complications (cataract, glaucoma, choroidal neovascularization) and systemic symptoms; consider baseline and periodic blood tests if on systemic immunosuppression.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: new onset of multiple black spots in the visual field of the right and left eyes for 2 weeks
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: OU
PATIENT QUOTES: "new onset of multiple black spots in the visual field of the right and left eyes for 2 weeks"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 32-year-old woman with a 10-year history of AIDS and CD4 count 64 on HAART presenting with 2 weeks of new onset multiple black spots (floaters) in the visual fields of both eyes.
History Narrative: A 32-year-old woman with a 10-year history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) complained of new onset of multiple black spots in the visual field of the right and left eyes for 2 weeks. She had a CD4 count of 64 and was on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 10 mm Hg in each eye. The anterior segment was unremarkable with no anterior chamber cell or flare. Funduscopic examination of the right eye showed creamy yellowish-white retinitis with prominent, associated hemorrhage within the lesion. There was active vitritis and vascular sheathing superior to the disc extending along the superotemporal arcade. The left eye had a peripheral area of retinitis temporally.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: CMV retinitis, OU, in a patient with AIDS.
Primary Diagnosis: CMV retinitis, OU
Secondary Diagnoses: AIDS (HIV infection), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection
Differential Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis; Acute retinal necrosis (herpetic retinitis); Ocular toxoplasmosis; Ocular syphilis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OU
Complications: Retinal detachment (40–50% within first year)


Plan
All Medications: highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); ganciclovir (IV 5 mg/kg induction, intravitreal 2000 μg, implant for sustained delivery); foscarnet (IV 60 mg/kg three times daily induction, intravitreal 1.2 mg); cidofovir (IV 5 mg/kg)
All Procedures: ophthalmoscopic screening every 3–6 months; indirect ophthalmoscopy; anterior chamber paracentesis for PCR; intravenous ganciclovir induction (5 mg/kg once daily); intravenous foscarnet induction (60 mg/kg three times daily); cidofovir IV induction (5 mg/kg weekly then q2 weeks maintenance); intravitreal ganciclovir injection (2000 µg); intravitreal foscarnet injection (1.2 mg); intravitreal ganciclovir implant insertion; pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade; laser demarcation of small peripheral retinal detachments
Follow-Up Instructions: Close follow-up with photographic documentation.
Patient Education: Explain that retinitis in the setting of AIDS is most commonly caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and can progress to severe vision loss if untreated. Symptoms often start with floaters, blurred vision, or peripheral black spots; report any new visual changes immediately. Diagnosis is by eye exam and sometimes PCR of eye fluid. Treatment includes systemic antiviral therapy (ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir) and/or intravitreal antivirals or a ganciclovir implant; discuss side effects (bone marrow suppression with ganciclovir, renal toxicity with foscarnet). Continued HIV care and maintaining/optimizing HAART to raise CD4 counts is essential to prevent recurrence. Regular ophthalmic follow-up (every 3–6 months if CD4 <100, more often while active disease) and prompt evaluation for symptoms reduce risk of complications such as retinal detachment, which may require surgery. Emphasize adherence to medications and follow-up, and notify clinicians about fever, systemic infections, or toxicities from antivirals.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 26-year-old healthy Caucasian man with 1-week history of bilateral decreased central vision and scotomas following a viral prodrome 3 weeks prior. Exam: BCVA 20/30 OU, normal IOPs, no APD, quiet anterior segment and vitreous. Fundus: multiple, flat, deep, creamy placoid lesions in the posterior pole OU. FA: multiple early hypofluorescent areas with late staining corresponding to lesions. ICG: decreased fluorescence of corresponding lesions. OCT: increased outer retinal reflectivity, disruption of outer segments and RPE abnormalities corresponding to clinical lesions. Findings most consistent with acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). Recommend observation given self-limited nature; consider oral corticosteroids if central macula involved or if neurologic signs suggesting CNS vasculitis. Evaluate for neurologic symptoms and consider neuroimaging if indicated. Follow with serial fundus photography, FA/ICG and OCT to document resolution and monitor for rare complications.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy
Differential Diagnosis: APMPPE; Serpiginous choroiditis; MEWDS; Birdshot chorioretinopathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: CNVM, CME, ERM, RPE atrophy/scarring, optic neuropathy, neovascular glaucoma


Plan
All Medications: oral corticosteroids periocular steroids immunosuppression (immunomodulatory therapy) cyclosporine mycophenolate azathioprine low-dose steroids antituberculosis therapy intravitreal steroids anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) laser photocoagulation
All Procedures: Fluorescein angiography (FA); Indocyanine green angiography (ICG); Optical coherence tomography (OCT); Dilated fundus examination (clinical fundus photography implied)
Patient Education: This condition involves inflammation of the outer retina and pigment layer (a “white dot” syndrome). It often follows a viral illness and typically improves on its own over weeks to months. Expect monitoring with eye imaging (fluorescein angiography, ICG, and OCT) to document lesions and healing. If lesions involve the central macula or if there are neurologic symptoms, oral corticosteroids or neurologic evaluation may be recommended. Report new symptoms promptly (worse vision, new central blind spot, severe headache, weakness, or confusion). Return for scheduled follow-up imaging and visual testing to watch for complications such as scarring or abnormal new blood vessels that may need treatment.
Referrals: neuroimaging with appropriate referral (neurology)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 1. Multiple retinal angiomas OS consistent with retinal angiomatosis (von Hippel lesions). 2. Associated von Hippel–Lindau disease given positive family history (father and two siblings) and characteristic funduscopic findings.
Primary Diagnosis: Multiple retinal angiomas
Secondary Diagnoses: von Hippel–Lindau disease
Differential Diagnosis: Cavernous hemangioma; Racemose hemangioma (arteriovenous malformation); Vasoproliferative tumor; Astrocytic hamartoma
Severity: Mild to moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: - Subretinal fluid and adjacent exudation leading to exudative retinal detachment - Epiretinal membrane formation and vitreoretinal traction (possible tractional or combined tractional–rhegmatogenous retinal detachment) - Hemorrhage during surgical intervention - Recurrence of lesion after treatment - Visual loss from macular involvement or retinal detachment


Plan
All Medications: Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (antiangiogenic medicines; systemic or intravitreal)
All Procedures: indirect ophthalmoscopy; slit‑lamp biomicroscopy; fluorescein angiography; fluorescein angioscopy; B‑scan ultrasonography; A‑scan ultrasonography; CT imaging; MRI with gadolinium; observation; laser photocoagulation; cryotherapy (double or triple freeze‑thaw); plaque radiotherapy; external beam radiotherapy; pars plana vitrectomy; intravitreal anti‑VEGF/anti‑PDGF therapy; systemic antiangiogenic therapy; genetic testing; 24‑hour urine collection for pheochromocytoma; CNS and thoracic/abdominal imaging; periodic ophthalmic examinations (annual to biannual)
Follow-Up Instructions: Annual to biannual ophthalmic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy for affected individuals and first‑degree relatives; periodic systemic screening including CNS and thoracic/abdominal imaging and 24‑hour urine collection for pheochromocytoma.
Patient Education: Explain that the retinal lesions are retinal angiomas associated with von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease, an inherited condition that can affect the eye and other organs. Reassure that the eye lesions may be monitored if small and not threatening vision, but can cause leaking, retinal detachment, or traction and therefore require treatment when causing or threatening vision loss. Discuss treatment options briefly: observation, laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, plaque or external beam radiotherapy, intravitreal anti‑VEGF in select cases, and possible vitreoretinal surgery for tractional complications, noting that treatment choice depends on lesion size and location. Emphasize need for regular ophthalmic follow-up (typically every 6–12 months or more often if active) with dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy and imaging (fundus photos, fluorescein angiography, and ultrasound as indicated). Advise genetic counseling and testing for VHL given family history, and explain systemic screening is essential (brain and spinal MRI, abdominal imaging for kidney and pancreatic lesions, and biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma such as annual plasma or 24‑hour urine catecholamines/metanephrines). Recommend that first‑degree relatives undergo screening. Warn about symptoms that require urgent attention: new vision loss, flashes, floaters, sudden pain, or systemic symptoms like headaches, hypertension, palpitations, or abdominal pain. Provide resources/referrals: genetic counselor, neuro‑ophthalmology/retina specialist, and multidisciplinary VHL clinic or center.
Referrals: Neuroimaging (CNS) and systemic screening with thoracic/abdominal imaging; referral to genetics for VHL testing and counseling; referral to oncology/urology or appropriate specialists for systemic evaluation (renal imaging, pheochromocytoma workup/endocrinology)


CASE 49 — Choroidal Melanoma
============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Photopsias and blurred central vision in the right eye for 3 days (with 2-week history of photopsias)
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old Caucasian man with 2 weeks of photopsias and 3 days of blurred central vision in the right eye.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 2-week history of photopsias and blurred central vision in the right eye for the previous 3 days. Past medical history was notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and skin cancer. Past ocular history was remarkable for macular degeneration. Examination disclosed a visual acuity of 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg in both eyes. There was a 1+ right afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination was notable for mild nuclear sclerotic alterations in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a dome-shaped moderately pigmented inferotemporal mass with an exudative retinal detachment located anterior to the mass. Examination of the left eye was unremarkable. The lesion had a thickness of 4.5 mm and base of 11.9 × 10.1 mm confirmed by echography. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated a dome-shaped lesion with an exudative retinal detachment and choroidal excavation. There was no evidence of extrascleral extension. A-scan ultrasonography revealed low internal reflectivity and a regular internal structure. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye demonstrated a lesion with intrinsic vascularity and progressive late leakage. The patient underwent a medical workup to rule out the presence of metastasis, including liver function tests and a chest X-ray that were unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with a medium-sized posterior uveal melanoma and underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy for gene-expression profiling at the time of iodine-125 radioactive plaque placement. Gene profiling yielded a class 1A tumor. Seven months following radioactive plaque therapy, visual acuity in the right eye was 20/40 with progressive nuclear sclerosis of the lens. The mass had decreased in size posttreatment to a height of 2.3 mm with significant pigmentary alterations and resolution of the overlying neurosensory detachment; the remainder of the retina showed no radiation-related changes.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Progression: Decreased (tumor reduced from 4.5 mm to 2.3 mm at 7 months posttreatment)
Characteristics: Dome-shaped moderately pigmented inferotemporal choroidal mass with intrinsic vascularity, low–medium internal reflectivity on A-scan, dome configuration with choroidal excavation and exudative retinal detachment, regular internal structure, sound attenuation, decreased size after plaque therapy with pigmentary alterations.

Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Hypercholesterolemia; Skin cancer; Macular degeneration; Nuclear sclerotic cataract (progressive)
Differential Diagnosis: Choroidal nevus; Metastatic carcinoma to the choroid; Choroidal hemangioma
Severity: Medium
Laterality: Right
Complications: radiation-related retinopathy, optic neuropathy, cataract, transient diplopia, radiation-vasculopathy, optic neuropathy (repeated), secondary glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage


Plan
All Medications: hypertension medication (unspecified) hypercholesterolemia medication (unspecified) iodine-125 radioactive plaque (brachytherapy) perioperative topical antibiotics 7–0 Vicryl suture 5–0 nylon suture
All Procedures: fine-needle aspiration biopsy for gene-expression profiling; iodine-125 radioactive plaque placement (plaque brachytherapy); ultrasonography (A-scan and B-scan); fundus photography; fluorescein angiography; liver function tests; chest X-ray
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up every 3 months during the first year, then every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly thereafter; perform clinical exam, fundus photography, and ultrasonography at each visit (AF and OCT as indicated); for gene-expression class 1A: annual liver imaging (and clinical metastatic surveillance)
Patient Education: Choroidal melanoma is a tumor of the layer beneath the retina (the choroid). It can cause decreased vision, flashes, and a retinal detachment. Diagnosis is based on eye exam and tests such as ultrasound, OCT, fluorescein angiography, and sometimes biopsy for gene-expression profiling. Treatment options depend on tumor size and location and include plaque brachytherapy (radiation to save the eye), local resection, or enucleation (removal of the eye) for large tumors. Fine-needle biopsy can provide prognostic gene-expression results (class 1A, 1B, or 2) that guide metastatic surveillance. After plaque therapy the tumor usually shrinks; common side effects include cataract, radiation retinopathy, and optic neuropathy. Follow-up schedule: every 3 months in year 1, every 6 months for years 2–3, then yearly; exams include clinical exam, fundus photos, and ultrasonography, with OCT/autofluorescence as needed. Metastatic surveillance is based on risk class: class 1A—annual liver imaging; class 1B—liver imaging and liver enzymes annually, staggered by 6 months; class 2—liver imaging and liver enzymes every 6 months staggered by 3 months. Report new systemic symptoms (right upper quadrant pain, unintended weight loss, fatigue) promptly. If vision worsens, notice new flashes, increased floaters, pain, or redness, seek urgent ophthalmic care.

=======================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden decreased vision in the left eye
DURATION: 6 years
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 64-year-old woman with sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after an extracapsular cataract extraction with PCIOL insertion; intraoperative central posterior capsular rupture occurred and the IOL was placed in the ciliary sulcus anterior to the remaining anterior capsule; postoperative exam showed 20/30 vision with aphakic correction, 2+ superior microbullous corneal edema, moderate anterior chamber cells, vitreous incarceration in the wound, clear pupillary space, no residual capsule noted, and a freely mobile PCIOL in the inferior vitreous cavity.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman presented with a sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) insertion. During the procedure, a central posterior capsular rupture was noted, but the IOL was placed anterior to the remaining anterior capsule into the ciliary sulcus. Her vision was 20/30 in the left eye with an aphakic correction. Slit-lamp examination showed a 2 + microbullous corneal edema superiorly and moderate cells in the anterior chamber. The pupil was round, but there was vitreous incarceration in the wound. The pupillary space was clear. Residual capsule was not noted.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens, left eye (PCIOL dislocation into vitreous cavity) following posterior capsular rupture during extracapsular cataract extraction; associated early postoperative corneal edema, anterior chamber inflammation with vitreous incarceration in the wound; retina attached. Surgical plan: pars plana vitrectomy with retrieval and scleral fixation of IOL haptics under partial-thickness scleral flaps; postoperative course: IOL well positioned, vision 20/60 at 1 month then 20/20 by 6 months and stable at 6 years.
Primary Diagnosis: Dislocated posterior chamber IOL, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Dislocated posterior chamber IOL due to posterior capsular rupture/insufficient capsular support; Zonular dehiscence (including pseudoexfoliation-related zonulopathy); IOL haptic malposition/rotation leading to sulcus instability; Traumatic IOL dislocation
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: Cystoid macular edema; elevated intraocular pressure; retinal detachment (low incidence); suture knot erosion; endophthalmitis; hemorrhage; IOL torsion or malposition; recurrent dislocation due to suture breakage; corneal endothelial trauma; postsurgical astigmatism; microbullous corneal edema; anterior chamber inflammation (cells); vitreous incarceration


Plan
All Medications: Topical miotics; topical anti-inflammatory agents; ocular hypotensive agents; aphakic correction (contact lens)
All Procedures: Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL insertion; pars plana vitrectomy; retrieval and scleral fixation (transscleral suturing) of dislocated posterior chamber IOL into the ciliary sulcus with placement of two partial‑thickness scleral flaps to cover suture knots
Follow-Up Instructions: Routine postoperative ophthalmic follow-up with serial exams to monitor visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior chamber inflammation, and retinal status; careful postoperative peripheral retinal examination for tears/detachment; timely visits within 1–2 weeks post-op (and sooner if symptoms), then periodic follow-up until stable (eg, 1 month and as clinically indicated).
Patient Education: Educate the patient about the diagnosis of a dislocated posterior‑chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL), causes (capsular rupture, zonular weakness, trauma, pseudoexfoliation), symptoms to report (new decreased vision, glare, monocular diplopia, pain, flashes/floaters), and the treatment options: observation with medical management (topical anti‑inflammatories, aqueous suppressants, topical miotics for symptomatic decentration), or surgical options (pars plana vitrectomy with IOL repositioning and transscleral suture fixation, IOL exchange/removal, or limbal approaches when appropriate). Explain benefits and risks of surgery (improved vision in most cases; risks include cystoid macular edema, elevated IOP, retinal tears/detachment, suture erosion, infection, recurrent dislocation), typical timing (usually within 2 weeks for acute symptomatic dislocation), and expected outcomes (most achieve 20/40 or better; long‑term good positioning possible). Advise perioperative care: need for postoperative visits, ocular inflammation control, activity restrictions, and to seek urgent care for worsening vision, increasing pain, new floaters or flashes.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema of the right eye (Irvine–Gass syndrome) 8 weeks after phacoemulsification with posterior capsular rupture and sulcus IOL placement. Patient reports initial excellent vision with decline beginning at 4 weeks; BCVA OD 20/80. Exam: quiet anterior segment, well-centered sulcus IOL, posterior vitreous detachment, macular thickening with cystic spaces on fundus exam and OCT (cysts in inner nuclear layer), fluorescein angiography with late petaloid perifoveal leakage. No history of diabetes or hypertension. Peripheral retina without breaks. Plan: initiate topical NSAID (e.g., ketorolac) and topical corticosteroid therapy with follow-up in 4–6 weeks; consider periocular/intravitreal steroid or surgical intervention (vitrectomy) if medical therapy fails or if vitreous traction/retained lens material is identified.
Primary Diagnosis: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema, OD
Secondary Diagnoses: Posterior vitreous detachment; Posterior capsular rupture (with vitreous loss); Pseudophakia (sulcus IOL)
Differential Diagnosis: Pseudophakic (postoperative) cystoid macular edema (Irvine–Gass syndrome); Diabetic macular edema; Uveitic (inflammatory) cystoid macular edema
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: Posterior vitreous detachment; cystoid macular edema (pseudophakic CME)


Plan
All Medications: 0.5% ketorolac ophthalmic drops (topical) four times daily for 4–6 weeks; 1% prednisolone ophthalmic drops four to eight times daily; topical flurbiprofen or suprofen (preoperative NSAIDs) as prophylaxis; periocular or intravitreal corticosteroid injections (e.g., triamcinolone) as second-line; intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept)
All Procedures: phacoemulsification with acrylic intraocular lens implantation into the ciliary sulcus
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe within 4–6 weeks after initiating medical treatment; if no improvement, escalate therapy; continue careful follow-up even after resolution due to risk of recurrence.
Patient Education: Cystoid macular edema (CME) is swelling in the central retina that can cause decreased vision after eye surgery. It often improves on its own within 3–4 months, but treatment can speed recovery and prevent permanent damage. Typical first-line treatment is topical anti-inflammatory eye drops (a steroid such as prednisolone and/or an NSAID such as ketorolac) used frequently for several weeks; if there is no improvement in 4–6 weeks, injections (periocular or intravitreal steroids) or referral for surgical options (e.g., vitrectomy) may be recommended in select cases. Follow-up is important because CME can recur and chronic CME can cause permanent vision loss; report any worsening vision promptly. If vitreous prolapse, retained lens fragments, or pupil/iris abnormalities are present, surgical correction may be needed. Also tell your surgeon about a history of diabetes, use of prostaglandin drops, or other inflammatory eye disease, as these affect management.


CASE 52 — Endophthalmitis
=========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 10/10 eye pain and decreased vision in her left eye upon awakening.
DURATION: 5 days
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I woke up with 10/10 eye pain and decreased vision in my left eye."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 59-year-old woman awoke 5 days after an uneventful combined cataract and LASIK procedure with severe (10/10) left eye pain and decreased vision. Postoperative course had been otherwise unremarkable until this abrupt onset. On presentation her left eye vision was hand motion with pronounced conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, anterior chamber inflammation with hypopyon, and fibrin on the intraocular lens; B‑scan showed moderately dense membranous vitreous opacities.
History Narrative: This 59-year-old woman awoke with 10/10 eye pain and decreased vision in her left eye. An uneventful combined cataract and LASIK procedure had been performed 5 days previously with a hitherto standard postoperative course. Her vision was hand motion, and there was pronounced conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, and anterior chamber reaction with hypopyon, as well as fibrin present on the intraocular lens (IOL). There was no view to the posterior pole and B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated moderately dense membranous vitreous opacities.
Symptom Onset: Awoke with symptoms 5 days after surgery
Symptom Duration: 5 days
Progression: Improved — vision progressed from hand motion at presentation to 20/40 at 1 week and 20/20 several months later after laser capsulotomy.
Characteristics: Vision-threatening inflammatory reaction of the intraocular fluids or tissues, presenting with pain, decreased vision, intraocular inflammation (hypopyon, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, anterior chamber fibrin), often with vitreous opacities and reduced view of the posterior pole, occurring postoperatively, posttrauma, bleb-associated, post–intravitreal injection, or endogenous hematogenous spread.

Plan
All Medications: vancomycin; ceftazidime; dexamethasone; topical fortified vancomycin; topical fortified ceftazidime; prednisolone; cyclopentolate; amikacin; fourth-generation fluoroquinolones; intracameral cefuroxime; povidone-iodine; topical antibiotics; subconjunctival antibiotics; preservative-containing triamcinolone; aflibercept; systemic antibiotics; systemic antifungals
All Procedures: combined cataract and LASIK procedure; vitreous tap and intravitreal injection of vancomycin, ceftazidime, and dexamethasone; topical fortified vancomycin and ceftazidime application; laser capsulotomy
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow clinically with gradual tapering of topical fortified antibiotics and prednisolone; monitor visual acuity and inflammation; perform retinal evaluation (ultrasound if view limited); arrange laser capsulotomy later if indicated.
Patient Education: You have an infection inside the eye called endophthalmitis, most likely related to your recent cataract/LASIK procedure. This is a serious condition that can cause rapid vision loss but can often be treated successfully if addressed promptly. What caused it - Bacteria entering the eye after surgery (most commonly skin bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis). Symptoms to expect - Severe eye pain, redness, decreased vision, light sensitivity, possible pus or whitish material in the eye. What we did and why - We took a sample of the vitreous (vitreous tap) to identify the organism. - We injected antibiotics directly into the eye (vancomycin and ceftazidime) to rapidly treat the infection. - We may add an anti-inflammatory injection (dexamethasone) to reduce damaging inflammation. - Topical fortified antibiotics and steroid drops were started to control surface and intraocular inflammation. - Ultrasound was used to assess the back of the eye since the view was blocked. What this means for your vision - Many patients improve substantially with prompt treatment; in similar cases vision often recovers to near normal over weeks to months, but severe infections can cause permanent loss. Close follow-up is essential. Home care and follow-up - Use all eye drops exactly as prescribed (frequency and schedule). - Keep follow-up appointments; you will need close monitoring (often daily at first). - Avoid touching or rubbing the eye; use a protective shield if advised. - Do not miss any urgent calls or visits — worsening pain, new floaters, sudden vision loss, or increasing redness require immediate evaluation. When additional surgery may be needed - If vision is only light perception or infection is severe, a pars plana vitrectomy (surgical removal of infected vitreous) may be recommended. - Chronic or indolent infections (e.g., Propionibacterium acnes) may require more extensive surgery including capsulectomy or IOL removal. Prevention for future procedures - Preoperative povidone-iodine antisepsis and sterile technique reduce risk. - The role of prophylactic topical antibiotics is unclear; intracameral antibiotics are used in some settings. If you have fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms or concerns, inform your primary doctor or seek emergency care. If you notice any worsening eye pain or vision changes, contact your ophthalmologist immediately.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhage of the left eye following complicated cataract surgery, with acute-onset severe pain, hand-motion vision, shallow anterior chamber, aphakia, and markedly elevated IOP (39 mm Hg). B-scan ultrasound confirmed appositional suprachoroidal hemorrhages with clotted blood initially and liquefaction by day 8. Elevated IOP was medically managed initially; after liquefaction, pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of the suprachoroidal hemorrhage and fluid–gas exchange was performed without a draining retinotomy because no retinal breaks were identified. Risk factors present include advanced age, hypertension, myopia, glaucoma, aphakia, recent intraocular surgery, and prior cardiac disease. Prognosis guarded; at 3 months postoperatively left-eye visual acuity was 20/400.
Primary Diagnosis: Appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhage
Secondary Diagnoses: Myopia (high myopia), Primary open-angle glaucoma, Systemic hypertension, History of cardiac bypass (coronary artery bypass graft)
Differential Diagnosis: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; Exudative (serous) retinal detachment; Serous choroidal effusion; Suprachoroidal hemorrhage
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhage; elevated intraocular pressure (left eye); shallow anterior chamber; aphakia; acute severe pain; loss of vision (hand motion → 20/400 at 3 months)

All Procedures: complicated cataract surgery (left eye); temporal clear cornea incision reapproximated with interrupted nylon sutures; anterior chamber paracentesis (considered/preoperative normalization mentioned); medical management of elevated intraocular pressure (topical/systemic IOP-lowering agents); pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhage and fluid–gas exchange; serial echography (B-scan ultrasonography); sclerotomy/draining sclerotomy (described as surgical option); 360-degree conjunctival limbal peritomy with isolation of rectus muscles (described as part of drainage procedure); placement of pars plana infusion cannula or limbal infusion (described); limited anterior vitrectomy (described as possible); perfluorocarbon liquid injection (described as option); scleral buckle and/or intraocular gas tamponade for coexisting retinal detachment (described)
Patient Education: You have a suprachoroidal hemorrhage, which is bleeding between the choroid and the sclera that can cause sudden severe eye pain and vision loss. It most often occurs around eye surgery or trauma and is more likely with high blood pressure, blood-thinning medicines, glaucoma, high myopia, or prior heart disease. Immediate goals: - Control eye pain and high eye pressure with prescribed drops and systemic medicines. - Protect the eye: keep head elevated, avoid heavy lifting/straining, and use any patching or shield recommended. - Attend all follow-up visits and scheduled ultrasounds (B-scan) to monitor whether the blood is liquefying. Treatment overview: - If the clot is still firm, we usually observe for about 7–14 days to allow liquefaction before surgical drainage. - If the pressure remains dangerously high, pain is severe, or the retina is apposed (“kissing” choroidals), urgent surgical drainage (often with vitrectomy) may be recommended. - Surgery aims to drain liquefied blood, relieve pressure, and repair any associated retinal problems; outcomes vary and vision may not fully recover. What to watch for (call immediately): - Worsening pain, sudden worsening of vision, increasing redness, discharge, or fever. - New light flashes, more floaters, or a curtain/veil over vision. Prognosis and expectations: - Recovery is variable; some vision may return but permanent vision loss is possible, especially with extensive hemorrhage or delayed drainage. - Rehabilitation may include additional surgeries, low-vision aids, and close glaucoma and retinal follow-up. Medications/precautions to discuss with your doctor: - Review blood thinners or anticoagulants before any intervention. - Continue or adjust glaucoma and pain medications as advised. - Use prescribed steroid or antibiotic eye drops if given. Bring a list of all medications, any bleeding disorders, recent surgeries, and your primary care/cardiology contact to appointments.


CASE 54 — Ruptured Globe
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor vision in the left eye after a fall (sudden vision loss)
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "I realized poor vision and sought consultation."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 80-year-old woman who fell at her nursing home the morning prior, with periocular ecchymoses suggesting direct blunt trauma to the eye from furniture; initially no pain or visual loss but woke the next morning with poor vision. Past ocular history: extracapsular cataract surgery with nuclear expression 3 years earlier and pre-injury vision 20/30 limited by atrophic macular degeneration. On presentation vision was hand motions, IOP 10 mm Hg; cornea relatively clear, formed anterior chamber, temporal and superior conjunctival chemosis, extensive subconjunctival hemorrhage, and scleral dehiscence at prior cataract wound with the posterior chamber IOL displaced into the subconjunctival space; dense vitreous hemorrhage limited posterior view. No peaked pupil, no vitreous anterior to the iris, and no afferent pupillary defect.
History Narrative: An 80-year-old woman presented the morning after falling at her nursing home. Exact history was unclear, but periocular ecchymoses suggested direct ocular trauma against a piece of furniture. Initially she had not noticed pain or visual loss, but upon waking the next morning she realized poor vision and sought consultation. She had undergone cataract surgery with a nuclear expression extracapsular technique 3 years previously; before the injury her vision had been 20/30 limited by atrophic macular degeneration. On presentation vision was hand motions and intraocular pressure 10 mm Hg. The cornea appeared relatively clear with a formed anterior chamber; there was conjunctival chemosis temporally and superiorly and extensive subconjunctival hemorrhage. No conjunctival laceration was seen, but a scleral dehiscence was evident at the previous cataract wound with the posterior chamber intraocular lens in the subconjunctival space in the superotemporal quadrant. The posterior view was limited by a dense vitreous hemorrhage. The pupil was not peaked and there was no vitreous anterior to the iris. No afferent pupillary defect was present.
Symptom Onset: The morning after falling at her nursing home
Symptom Duration: 1 day
Progression: Improved
Characteristics: Ruptured globe involving dehiscence of previous cataract wound with subconjunctival IOL, conjunctival chemosis, dense vitreous hemorrhage, no APD, formed anterior chamber, aphakia, focal subretinal hemorrhage (superotemporal midperiphery), no retinal detachment.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 80-year-old woman with left eye ruptured globe from blunt trauma (fall) with prior extracapsular cataract incision dehiscence and subconjunctival dislocation of the posterior chamber IOL. Presentation: hand motions vision, IOP 10 mm Hg, formed anterior chamber, clear cornea, temporal and superior conjunctival chemosis and extensive subconjunctival hemorrhage; no conjunctival laceration but scleral dehiscence at prior cataract wound with IOL in subconjunctival space; dense vitreous hemorrhage limiting posterior view; pupil not peaked; no vitreous anterior to iris; no afferent pupillary defect. Underwent same-day pars plana vitrectomy, removal of intraocular lens, and placement of encircling scleral buckle. Intraoperatively there was vitreous incarceration/streaming to the wound and a focal subretinal hemorrhage in the superotemporal midperiphery; no retinal detachment. Postoperative course: at 3 months retina attached posteriorly with minimal epiretinal membrane; organized subretinal hemorrhage at buckle base causing localized traction but nonprogressive; final visual acuity 20/100 with aphakic correction. Impression: Ruptured globe OS due to dehiscence of previous cataract wound with subconjunctival IOL and vitreous hemorrhage, successfully managed with primary globe repair and early vitrectomy with scleral buckle and IOL removal, resulting in attached retina and moderate visual recovery to 20/100 (aphakic).
Primary Diagnosis: Ruptured globe, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Occult globe rupture at previous cataract incision; Open globe rupture from limbal/scleral laceration; Traumatic lens/IOL dehiscence with vitreous prolapse; Traumatic vitreous hemorrhage without full-thickness rupture
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS
Complications: subconjunctival hemorrhage; vitreous hemorrhage; scleral dehiscence with extrusion of intraocular lens; aphakia; subretinal hemorrhage; epiretinal membrane; traction at buckle/base of sclera; potential risk of endophthalmitis; reduced visual acuity (20/100)


Plan
All Medications: broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics; tetanus immunization (if not given within 5 years); viscoelastic substance (intraoperative)
All Procedures: vitrectomy; placement of encircling scleral band (scleral buckle); removal of intraocular lens (IOL explantation); primary closure of corneoscleral laceration (wound repair)
Follow-Up Instructions: As long as anatomic and visual stabilization is observed, lengthen follow-up intervals; monitor for cicatricial response for ~6 weeks post-op; consider additional surgery (epiretinal membrane removal or secondary IOL) at ~3 months if indicated; recommend shatter‑proof safety glasses and vocational rehabilitation as needed.
Patient Education: - Place a protective eye shield over the injured eye to avoid further trauma or pressure. - Receive broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to reduce risk of endophthalmitis. - Ensure tetanus vaccination if not given within the last 5 years. - Avoid manipulating the eye; keep head elevated and activity limited until seen by ophthalmology. - Expect prompt surgical repair to close the wound; possible later (1–2 weeks) secondary vitrectomy, scleral buckle, or lens removal depending on injury. - Understand that vision may be reduced (this case resulted in 20/100 with aphakic correction) and further rehabilitative options (IOL implantation, contact lenses, epiretinal membrane surgery) may be considered after recovery (~3 months). - Wear shatter-proof safety glasses for the other eye to prevent future injury. - Follow-up closely in the first week and for several months; seek urgent care for increasing pain, redness, discharge, or sudden vision loss.
Work Restrictions: Avoid heavy lifting, straining, and activities with risk of ocular trauma; wear protective/shatter-proof eyewear; limit work requiring fine visual acuity or binocular depth perception until cleared by ophthalmology.

CASE 55 — Intraocular Foreign Body
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision in left eye after metal-on-metal impact (suspected intraocular foreign body)
DURATION: 25 years
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "I felt a minor pain in my left eye and later noticed my vision getting a bit worse, like something small had gone into my eye."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 32-year-old man working aboard a docked marine biology research ship repairing a metal banister struck the metal rail with a hammer and felt minor left eye pain. Over the next 2 hours he noted a subtle but definite decrease in vision. On presentation his left eye vision was 20/30. He reported the incident of metal-to-metal impact without protective eyewear; exam showed a temporal peripheral corneal slitlike entry about 1 mm from the limbus, a defect in the temporal iris, a sectoral white opacity in the peripheral lens, and an intraocular foreign body embedded in the temporal midperipheral retina with a collar of retinal edema.
History Narrative: A 32-year-old man was working aboard a docked marine biology research ship repairing a metal banister. While striking the metal rail with a metal hammer, he experienced a minor pain in his left eye. Over the ensuing 2 hours, he noticed a subtle but definite decrease in vision. On presentation, his visual acuity was 20/30. Slit-lamp examination showed a deep anterior chamber with minimal cell and flare. There was a defect in the temporal iris approximately 1mm from the limbus. Corresponding to this site was a slitlike corneal defect that was not leaking aqueous fluid by Seidel testing. Posterior to the iris, there was a sectoral, white opacity in the peripheral lens. Examination of the posterior pole disclosed a small intraocular foreign body embedded in the retinal midperiphery with a collar of retinal edema surrounding it but no hemorrhage.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body OS with entry through temporal peripheral cornea, iris, and lens causing localized peripheral lens opacity and a small midperipheral retinal impact with surrounding edema. Globe integrity maintained with self-sealing corneal wound. No initial vitreous hemorrhage or endophthalmitis. Management: prompt pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy, posterior chamber IOL implantation using fellow-eye biometry, intraoperative induction of PVD, magnetic extraction of metallic IOFB, laser photocoagulation around retinal impact, and placement of a low encircling scleral buckle. Postoperative course notable for attached retina and recovery to 20/20 vision, maintained over 25 years.
Primary Diagnosis: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Retained intraocular foreign body (metallic/siderotic IOFB); Traumatic cataract with lens penetration; Penetrating globe injury with vitreous hemorrhage/retinal impact; Endophthalmitis from contaminated ocular penetration
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: endophthalmitis; retinal detachment; siderosis (from metallic IOFB); hemorrhage; persistent decreased vision/epiretinal membrane; cataract/lens opacity; vitreous hemorrhage; retinal breaks; intraoperative expulsive hemorrhage (if wound leaking)


Plan
All Medications: intravenous antibiotics; topical corticosteroids; topical antibiotics; topical cycloplegic agents; systemic antibiotics; intravitreal antibiotics
All Procedures: vitrectomy; lensectomy; intraocular lens implantation; magnetic extraction of intraocular foreign body; low encircling scleral buckle placement; laser photocoagulation surrounding retinal defect; induction of posterior vitreous detachment with vitrectomy instrument; scleral wound closure (as needed)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observed at approximately 1–2 week intervals in the first month, then less frequently thereafter; monitor for recurrent retinal detachment and visually significant epiretinal membrane; if no endophthalmitis within 24–48 hours and good progress, discontinue systemic antibiotics.
Patient Education: Seek immediate care for eye injuries, especially after metal-on-metal work—do not delay if you notice pain, decreased vision, or a feeling of something in the eye. Always wear proper protective eyewear when working with metal or power tools. Do not undergo MRI until a metallic foreign body is ruled out. If an intraocular foreign body is suspected, prompt evaluation and likely imaging (X-ray, CT, or ultrasound) are needed, and early surgical removal and prophylactic antibiotics may be required to prevent infection and vision loss. Postoperatively, follow prescribed topical/systemic antibiotics and antiinflammatories, attend frequent follow-up visits to monitor for retinal detachment or infection, and discuss timing of intraocular lens placement if aphakic.
Work Restrictions: Avoidance of heavy lifting, straining, and contact work; no return to hazardous/industrial tasks without protective eyewear until cleared by ophthalmology.
Emergency Instructions: Urgent evaluation and prompt surgical removal of suspected intraocular foreign body (ideally within 6–12 hours); avoid MRI until nonmagnetic status confirmed; obtain plain films/CT and/or B-scan as indicated; start broad‑spectrum systemic (and consider intravitreal) antibiotics for endophthalmitis prophylaxis; protect globe and arrange immediate ophthalmic surgical consultation for vitrectomy/lensectomy/IOFB removal.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 35-year-old woman with acute unilateral (right) visual loss over 12 days, periocular pain worsened with eye movement, decreased color vision (3/10 plates), a right RAPD, superior arcuate visual field defect, VA 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS, and a mildly hyperemic/swollen right optic disc without hemorrhages or significant vitreous inflammation. Clinical picture is most consistent with typical demyelinating optic neuritis (papillitis/anterior ON). MRI of the brain/orbits to evaluate for demyelinating lesions and to assess risk for multiple sclerosis is indicated; consider testing for NMO (AQP4-IgG) and MOG antibodies if MRI is atypical or if clinical course is atypical. Recommend treatment per ONTT with IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone for more rapid recovery and consideration of MS risk reduction if MRI shows demyelinating lesions. Follow visual function closely for improvement over weeks to months and pursue further infectious or inflammatory workup only if atypical features or lack of expected recovery.
Primary Diagnosis: Typical optic neuritis (papillitis)
Differential Diagnosis: Demyelinating optic neuritis (idiopathic/MS-related); Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‑IgG associated); MOG-antibody–associated optic neuritis; Infectious/inflammatory optic neuropathy (e.g., syphilis, Lyme, sarcoidosis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Risk of developing multiple sclerosis; potential for residual visual loss (persistent decreased acuity, dyschromatopsia, visual field defects); possible progression to neuromyelitis optica with worse visual prognosis.


Plan
All Medications: methylprednisolone sodium succinate (IV), oral prednisone
All Procedures: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits; Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (high-dose IV steroids) followed by oral prednisone taper
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for visual acuity and visual fields in 2–4 weeks; neuro-ophthalmology/neurology referral and brain and orbital MRI with contrast (if not already done) to assess for demyelinating lesions; consider AQP4 (NMO) and MOG antibody testing if atypical features or poor recovery; consider IV methylprednisolone treatment if rapid recovery desired or MRI abnormal (discuss risks/benefits); monitor for improvement over months and reassess if no improvement by 3–4 weeks.
Patient Education: You have optic neuritis — inflammation of the optic nerve that commonly causes sudden, usually one-sided vision loss, eye pain with movement, and color vision changes. Most cases in young adults improve over weeks to months; with typical optic neuritis many people begin to see better within 2–4 weeks and continue to improve for up to a year. Your doctor ordered an MRI to look for signs of demyelinating disease (which increases the risk of multiple sclerosis) and to rule out other causes. Treatment options include high‑dose IV corticosteroids to speed recovery (often followed by an oral taper); standard‑dose oral prednisone alone is not recommended. If tests suggest neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or MOG-related disease, additional immunologic testing and different long‑term treatments may be needed. Rest, avoid overheating or strenuous exercise if it worsens your vision (Uhthoff’s phenomenon), and report any new neurologic symptoms or worsening vision promptly. Follow-up visits are important to monitor recovery and discuss longer‑term neurologic evaluation and treatment options if MRI or blood tests are abnormal.

Bartonella henselae IgM and IgG markedly positive. Impression: optic disc edema with macular star (neuroretinitis) secondary to cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae).
Primary Diagnosis: Neuroretinitis (Optic Disc Edema with Macular Star)
Differential Diagnosis: Infectious or idiopathic neuroretinitis (e.g., Bartonella henselae); papilledema (if bilateral); ocular inflammatory/infectious causes (syphilis, Lyme, toxoplasmosis); vascular optic neuropathies (AION, CRVO/BRVO, hypertensive/diabetic papillopathy)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy and macular retinal pigment epithelial changes; possible residual visual disability.


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Reevaluate within 2 weeks for development of a macular star; monitor visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields; arrange infectious workup results review and initiate/adjust antibiotics if Bartonella or other pathogen confirmed; fundus exam follow-up until resolution and to monitor for optic atrophy or macular pigmentary changes.
Patient Education: You have neuroretinitis (optic disc swelling with a macular star), most likely from cat‑scratch disease caused by Bartonella. This condition often improves over weeks to months, but vision can take time to recover and some permanent changes can occur. Recommended points: - Avoid close contact with cats’ saliva and scratches; wash any cat scratches thoroughly and seek care for infected wounds. - Take prescribed antibiotics as directed (treatment is recommended when a specific infectious cause like Bartonella is identified). - Report new or worsening vision loss, increasing eye pain, new headaches, fever, or signs of systemic infection right away. - Expect follow‑up eye exams (including vision, pupils, and retinal exam) over weeks to months to monitor resolution and watch for a macular star that can appear later. - If steroid therapy is discussed, understand benefits are uncertain and it would be used only in specific situations under specialist guidance. - Contact information for urgent eye care and schedule regular ophthalmology follow‑up as instructed.
Work Restrictions: Avoid heavy visual tasks, driving, and operating machinery until visual acuity and fields have stabilized; limit activities requiring good depth perception or binocular vision; follow-up in 2 weeks or sooner for reassessment.


CASE 58 — Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy—Nonarteritic
=========================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Severe visual loss in the left eye upon awakening 3 days ago
DURATION: 3 days
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "on awakening from sleep 3 days ago she noted severe visual loss in the left eye."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 65-year-old woman with sudden, painless severe vision loss in the left eye noticed on awakening 3 days ago; denies headache, eye pain, jaw claudication, transient visual loss, or other neurologic/ophthalmologic symptoms; history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
History Narrative: A 65-year-old woman reports sudden severe painless visual loss in the left eye noted upon awakening 3 days ago. She denies headache, eye pain, jaw claudication, transient visual loss, or other neurologic/ophthalmologic symptoms. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 65-year-old woman with sudden, painless left monocular vision loss on awakening 3 days prior. Exam: OD 20/20, OS 20/200; color vision 10/10 OD, 2/10 OS; dense inferior altitudinal visual field defect OS; 3 mm pupils bilaterally with a left relative afferent pupillary defect; OD cup-to-disc ratio 0.1 (small “disc at risk”); OS diffuse optic disc swelling with peripapillary hemorrhages. Vascular risk factors: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia. Clinical presentation and findings are most consistent with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), OS. Giant cell arteritis is less likely given absence of systemic symptoms, but ESR and CRP should be obtained to exclude arteritic AION in the workup. Control of vascular risk factors and consideration of aspirin discussed; no proven effective therapy for NAION.
Primary Diagnosis: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), left eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus; Hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Arteritic (giant cell) anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; optic neuritis; compressive optic neuropathy; infiltrative/inflammatory optic neuropathy
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS
Complications: Risk of involvement of the fellow eye (≈12% lifetime risk); permanent visual loss in the affected eye (optic atrophy); decreased color vision; visual field defects (e.g., altitudinal defect); potential cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction) related to shared vascular risk factors


Plan
All Medications: Aspirin, corticosteroids (considered), phenytoin, erythropoietin, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, topical brimonidine, levodopa
Follow-Up Instructions: Control vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), consider aspirin therapy, monitor vision and the fellow eye for AION, obtain ESR and CRP to evaluate for giant cell arteritis (and consider temporal artery biopsy if elevated or clinically suspicious), avoid iatrogenic hypotension, and arrange ophthalmology follow-up for visual and fundus reassessment.
Patient Education: You have nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), which causes sudden, usually painless vision loss in one eye due to decreased blood flow to the optic nerve. Common contributing factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a small optic cup in the other eye. Important points: - There is no proven effective treatment to reverse NAION, though some patients have partial spontaneous improvement over months. - Control vascular risk factors: tightly manage blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol; stop smoking; avoid episodes of low blood pressure (especially at night) and significant blood loss. - Your risk of NAION in the other eye is increased (~10–15% lifetime); aspirin may be discussed to possibly reduce risk of further vascular events. - Giant cell arteritis (a treatable cause of arteritic AION) must be excluded if you develop new symptoms such as headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, or unexplained muscle aches; blood tests (ESR, CRP) or urgent evaluation may be needed. - Regular follow-up with your ophthalmologist and primary care physician or cardiologist is recommended to monitor vision and optimize systemic risk factor control. Consider low-vision rehabilitation if visual function affects daily activities.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 68-year-old woman with acute, severe, left visual loss over hours with preceding transient monocular visual obscurations, headaches, jaw claudication, and polymyalgia rheumatica–like symptoms. Exam: VA 20/20 OD, 20/400 OS, marked color loss OS, left RAPD, left optic disc swollen, pale with peripapillary hemorrhages; fellow eye cup-to-disc 0.5 (no “disc at risk”). ESR 70 mm/h and CRP 20 mg/dL. Temporal artery biopsy with transmural lymphocytic infiltrate, multinucleated giant cells, and internal elastic lamina disruption. Impression: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy due to giant cell arteritis. Immediate high‑dose corticosteroid therapy indicated to prevent further vision loss; temporal artery biopsy confirms diagnosis and systemic rheumatologic management and steroid‑sparing considerations recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (arteritic AION)
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Polymyalgia rheumatica; Giant cell arteritis
Differential Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (giant cell arteritis); Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Central retinal artery occlusion; Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Further visual loss in the involved or fellow eye; permanent severe vision loss (including bilateral vision loss); ocular ischemic events (CRAO, PION, choroidal ischemia); systemic complications of high‑dose corticosteroid therapy (e.g., steroid side effects)


Plan
All Medications: prednisone (oral, initial dose 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day); methylprednisolone (IV, 1000 mg/day); methotrexate (as a steroid-sparing option)
All Procedures: temporal artery biopsy
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful monitoring for visual changes and constitutional symptoms; serial ESR/CRP testing; regular ophthalmology follow-up to monitor involved and fellow eye; monitor for steroid adverse effects with internist/rheumatologist collaboration; consider temporal artery biopsy confirmation and evaluate need for steroid-sparing therapy (e.g., methotrexate) if steroid side effects occur.
Patient Education: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammation of medium–large blood vessels that can cause sudden, severe vision loss. Your symptoms (sudden visual loss in one eye, prior brief episodes of vision loss, headaches, jaw pain, and pale swollen optic disc) and blood tests (high ESR and CRP) indicate arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy from GCA. Immediate treatment with high‑dose corticosteroids is essential to reduce the risk of further or bilateral vision loss; do not delay treatment for biopsy. A temporal artery biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. You will need close follow‑up with ophthalmology and a physician (rheumatologist or internist) to monitor vision, inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), and steroid side effects. Most patients taper steroids over many months, but some require longer therapy or steroid‑sparing medications if side effects occur. Seek urgent care for any new visual symptoms, worsening vision, new severe headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, or signs of steroid complications (e.g., high blood sugar, severe weakness).
Referrals: Internist and/or rheumatologist
Emergency Instructions: Start high‑dose corticosteroids immediately to prevent further visual loss; do not delay treatment for temporal artery biopsy. Seek urgent ophthalmology/rheumatology and consider hospitalization for IV methylprednisolone if severe, bilateral, monocular status, or vision loss <48 hours. Monitor vision, systemic symptoms, and ESR/CRP; arrange temporal artery biopsy and coordination with internist for steroid side‑effect management.


CASE 60 — Progressive Optic Neuropathy—Tumor
============================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: painless progressive visual loss in her right eye
DURATION: 3 years
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "vision was no better after the surgery"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 64-year-old woman with a several-year history of painless, progressive visual loss in the right eye beginning ~3 years ago with initial mild blurring and acuity 20/40 OD, progressive decline to 20/60 then to 20/100 despite right cataract surgery one year after onset; associated decreased color vision OD, diffuse visual field depression OD, a right relative afferent pupillary defect, and progressive optic nerve pallor, with no headache or eye pain.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman with a multi-year history of painless progressive visual loss in the right eye. Three years earlier she noticed mild blurring and was found to have right VA 20/40 and left 20/20, attributed to nuclear sclerotic cataract and observed. Vision worsened over the next year to 20/60 in the right eye, and she underwent right cataract surgery, with no improvement. She continued to worsen without headache or eye pain. At presentation her vision was 20/100 OD and 20/20 OS; color vision 2/10 OD and 9/10 OS. Visual field testing showed diffuse depression OD and normal OS. Pupils 5 mm bilaterally, poorly reactive on the right and brisk on the left with a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Ocular motility was normal. Hertel exophthalmometry (base 95) measured 22 mm OD and 19 mm OS. Slit-lamp exam showed a posterior chamber IOL OD and mild nuclear sclerotic cataract OS. Fundus exam demonstrated a pale, atrophic right optic nerve and a normal left optic disc.
Symptom Onset: 3 years ago
Symptom Duration: 3 years
Progression: Progressive over years (gradual worsening over ~3 years)
Characteristics: Painless progressive unilateral visual loss with relative afferent pupillary defect, decreased color vision, diffuse visual field depression, optic nerve pallor/atrophy, mild proptosis, optic nerve sheath enhancement on MRI consistent with optic nerve sheath meningioma


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: painless progressive visual loss, decreased color vision, mild proptosis, no headache or eye pain
Previous Episodes: Recurrent progressive visual blurring in right eye over 3 years with gradual worsening despite cataract surgery (symptoms present for ~3 years)
Prior Treatments: Right cataract surgery (right posterior chamber intraocular lens)
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — significant impairment in right-eye–dependent tasks (reduced acuity, color vision, and visual field) but overall bilateral vision preserved (left eye 20/20), allowing most activities with adaptations.

Fundus Exam – Optic Nerve: Pale, atrophic nerve on the right
Fundus Exam – Macula: Macula flat and unremarkable bilaterally


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Compressive optic neuropathy of the right eye secondary to an optic nerve sheath meningioma. Painless progressive visual loss over years with decreased visual acuity (20/100 OD), decreased color vision (2/10 Ishihara OD), diffuse visual field depression OD, right relative afferent pupillary defect, mild right proptosis, and optic disc pallor consistent with chronic optic nerve compression. MRI brain and orbits with gadolinium demonstrated optic nerve sheath enhancement on the right consistent with an optic nerve sheath meningioma. Plan: close observation with serial clinical exams, visual fields and repeat MRI (e.g., every 6 months x2 years then yearly if stable); consider stereotactic conformal radiation therapy if progressive visual deterioration.
Primary Diagnosis: Compressive optic neuropathy (right) due to optic nerve sheath meningioma
Differential Diagnosis: Compressive optic neuropathy from optic nerve sheath meningioma; optic nerve glioma; orbital/intracanalicular metastasis (or lymphoma); thyroid-related compressive optic neuropathy
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy with permanent visual loss (progressive vision loss), relative afferent pupillary defect, decreased color vision, visual field loss, possible proptosis, potential need for radiation therapy or vision loss from tumor progression.


Plan
All Procedures: observation; cataract surgery (right posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and orbit with gadolinium; stereotactic/conformal radiation therapy (if progressive); surgical debulking or gross total/subtotal resection (for intracranial meningioma with optic canal extension)
Follow-Up Instructions: Serial clinical reevaluation (e.g., every 6 months) including visual fields and repeat MRI of the brain and orbit (e.g., every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly if no growth or clinical progression).
Patient Education: Compressive optic neuropathy from an optic nerve sheath meningioma causes gradual, painless vision loss and may produce an afferent pupillary defect and optic nerve pallor. MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium is the key test to confirm the diagnosis. Management options include careful observation with regular visual acuity, color vision, and visual field testing and periodic MRIs (about every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly if stable), or radiotherapy if vision worsens. Surgery is rarely recommended for primary optic nerve sheath meningioma except for select cases with exophytic growth or intracranial extension. Report any new or worsening vision changes, pain, headaches, or double vision promptly. Discuss low-vision aids and rehabilitation if vision loss is significant.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Papilledema due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): 22‑year‑old obese woman with an 8‑month history of daily diffuse headaches, 2 months of pulsatile (pulse‑synchronous) tinnitus, and 2 weeks of transient visual obscurations. Examination: obese (250 lb), BP 135/85, VA 20/20 OU, normal color vision, enlarged blind spots OU, no RAPD, normal motility, bilateral severe optic disc swelling with exudates and hemorrhages. MRI showed signs of increased intracranial pressure (bilateral optic nerve sheath CSF signal, empty sella); MRV normal. Lumbar puncture: opening pressure 350 mm H2O with normal CSF contents. No secondary cause identified. Recommend weight reduction and medical therapy (acetazolamide) with close serial monitoring of visual function; consider surgical options (CSF shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration) if visual function worsens or medical therapy fails.
Primary Diagnosis: Pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
Secondary Diagnoses: Obesity (morbid obesity)
Differential Diagnosis: Papilledema from idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri); Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; Intracranial mass lesion/hydrocephalus causing raised intracranial pressure; Malignant hypertension (hypertensive retinopathy)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Vision loss


Plan
All Medications: acetazolamide; methazolamide; furosemide; corticosteroids (systemic); ventricular/lumboperitoneal shunt (surgical, not a medication)
All Procedures: MRI head with and without contrast; MR venography (MRV); Lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement and CSF analysis; Acetazolamide therapy (medical management); Serial formal visual fields, stereo-optic disc photography, OCT of the optic nerves, visual acuity and color vision testing (ongoing monitoring); CSF shunting (ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal) (surgical option); Optic nerve sheath fenestration (surgical option)
Follow-Up Instructions: Return monthly for 6–12 months with careful evaluation of formal visual fields, stereo optic-disc photos, OCT of the optic nerves, visual acuity, color vision, and RAPD testing; spacing of visits may be lengthened once findings are stable, but continue long-term follow-up for possible recurrence or shunt failure.
Patient Education: Weight loss is important and can improve intracranial pressure; avoid medications known to raise intracranial pressure when possible. IIH requires regular monitoring of vision (visual fields, acuity, color, OCT) and prompt reporting of any worsening vision, new visual obscurations, persistent headache changes, or new double vision. Medical treatment often includes acetazolamide (1–2 g/day) and sometimes furosemide; discuss pregnancy risks with your obstetrician before using carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Repeated lumbar punctures are not a routine primary therapy. If vision worsens despite medical therapy, surgical options (optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting) may be considered. Maintain follow-up monthly for 6–12 months, then less often if stable. Seek urgent care for sudden vision loss.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressive painless visual impairment in the right eye for 1½ years
DURATION: 1.5 years
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have progressive painless visual impairment in my right eye over the past 1 and 1/2 years."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Progressive painless visual impairment in the right eye for 1½ years; denied visual difficulty in the left eye or other neurologic/ophthalmologic symptoms.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man complained of progressive painless visual impairment in his right eye over a period of 1½ years. He denied any visual difficulty in his left eye and denied any other history of neurologic or ophthalmologic impairment. Examination revealed visual acuity of 20/80 on the right and 20/20 on the left. He could identify 4 of 10 pseudoisochromatic plates on the right and 10 of 10 on the left. Pupils were 4 mm bilaterally and both reacted well to light and near, but there was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Visual fields revealed generalized diffuse depression on the right and a superotemporal field defect respecting the vertical meridian on the left. Motility exam was normal. Slit‑lamp examination was normal. The right optic disc was diffusely pale. The left optic disc, vessels, and macula were normal.
Symptom Onset: 1.5 years
Symptom Duration: 1.5 years
Progression: Progressive over 1.5 years
Characteristics: Progressive painless right optic neuropathy with right central scotoma, right optic atrophy, right RAPD, generalized diffuse depression on right visual field and contralateral superior temporal (junctional) visual field defect due to compressive lesion (pituitary adenoma)


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Progressive visual loss was painless and worsened over 1.5 years; compressive lesion (pituitary adenoma) causing optic nerve/chiasm compression—so tumor growth/compression is the aggravating factor.
Associated Symptoms: progressive painless visual impairment in the right eye; denied other neurologic or ophthalmologic symptoms
Previous Episodes: None
Prior Treatments: Surgical decompression (decompressive surgery)
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — impaired right-eye vision with central scotoma and contralateral superior-temporal field loss causing reduced visual function (reading, depth perception, driving) but retained useful vision in left eye.
Systemic Symptoms: Denies any other neurologic or ophthalmologic impairment
Recent Travel: No recent travel reported

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right optic neuropathy with junctional scotoma caused by compressive lesion at the right optic nerve–chiasm junction (pituitary adenoma) leading to progressive painless right visual loss, right RAPD, right optic atrophy with central scotoma and contralateral superotemporal field defect.
Primary Diagnosis: Right optic neuropathy with junctional scotoma secondary to compressive lesion at the junction of the right optic nerve and chiasm (pituitary adenoma)
Differential Diagnosis: Pituitary adenoma; suprasellar meningioma; craniopharyngioma; supraclinoid aneurysm
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy with persistent visual field loss (junctional scotoma) and potential endocrine dysfunction from pituitary adenoma (requiring hormone replacement); risk of residual or recurrent tumor postoperatively requiring further surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.


Plan
All Medications: dopamine agonists; hormone replacement
All Procedures: Visual field testing (perimetry) Pupillary examination (including RAPD testing) Color vision testing (pseudoisochromatic plates) Visual acuity testing Slit-lamp examination Dilated fundus/optic disc examination Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/sellar region Surgical decompression (transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection) Histopathologic examination of resected tissue Postoperative serial visual field testing and ophthalmic follow-up
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up ophthalmologic exam with visual field testing every 4 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter, with periodic MRIs to monitor for tumor growth.
Patient Education: You have a compressive lesion (pituitary tumor) pressing where the right optic nerve meets the optic chiasm, causing progressive, painless vision loss in your right eye and a small visual field defect in the left eye. Recommended steps: - Undergo MRI to confirm and monitor the tumor. - Treatment usually involves surgical decompression to relieve pressure on the optic nerves; additional therapy (radiation or medication) depends on tumor type. - If the tumor affects hormone glands, hormone replacement or medical therapy (e.g., dopamine agonists for prolactinomas) may be needed. - Visual function (acuity, color vision, visual fields) and MRI should be followed regularly after treatment (every ~4 months for the first year, then about every 6 months). - Report any new symptoms immediately (worsening vision, double vision, headaches, changes in pituitary/hormonal symptoms). - Ask your team about visual rehabilitation options and referral to low-vision services if needed.
Referrals: Neurosurgery and neuro-ophthalmology (neurosurgical decompression with neuro-ophthalmic follow-up)
Emergency Instructions: Seek urgent neuroimaging (MRI brain with pituitary protocol) and urgent neurosurgical/endocrine consultation for evaluation and decompression; if acute severe vision loss or progressive deficit, arrange immediate transfer to tertiary center for urgent surgical decompression.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 63-year-old woman with progressive painless bilateral visual blurring and headaches for ~1 year, visual acuity 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS, normal pupils and fundi, visual fields demonstrating bitemporal hemianopia consistent with chiasmal compression. MRI of the sellar region demonstrates a pituitary macroadenoma causing optic chiasm compression. Plan: neuroimaging-confirmed pituitary adenoma; refer for endocrinologic evaluation and neurosurgical consultation for likely surgical decompression (medical therapy if prolactinoma), with postoperative visual field and hormonal follow-up.
Primary Diagnosis: Bitemporal visual field defect secondary to pituitary macroadenoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Pituitary macroadenoma
Differential Diagnosis: Pituitary adenoma; Craniopharyngioma; Meningioma; Chiasmal glioma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: acetaminophen
All Procedures: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella with and without gadolinium; Computed tomography (CT) scan (if MRI contraindicated or emergent); Endocrinologic evaluation; Surgical resection of pituitary adenoma (transsphenoidal surgery); Postoperative hormonal replacement as needed; Postoperative radiation therapy (if required); Serial visual field testing and ophthalmologic examinations (postop at ~3 months, then 6-month intervals for 2 years, yearly for 5 years, then every 2 years); Serial MRI surveillance (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, then yearly for several years).
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative: visual field and ophthalmologic exam as soon as tolerated. Then visual fields and serial ophthalmologic exams at ~3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly for 5 years, then every 2 years thereafter. MRI of the sella at ~6 months, 1 year, then yearly for several years. Endocrinologic follow-up and hormonal replacement as indicated.
Patient Education: You have a lesion near the optic chiasm (most likely a pituitary tumor) causing the loss of peripheral (side) vision in both eyes. This explains your blurred vision and driving problems. Recommended next steps: - Obtain MRI of the brain with special attention to the sella (with and without gadolinium) to define the mass. - Have blood tests for pituitary hormone levels (prolactin, ACTH/cortisol, TSH, free T4, LH/FSH, IGF-1) to check for a functioning tumor. - Consultation with a neurosurgeon and an endocrinologist to discuss treatment options (medical therapy for prolactinomas, or transsphenoidal surgery for most compressive adenomas; radiation may be needed in some cases). - If vision is severely affected or worsening, surgery is often urgent to relieve pressure on the optic chiasm. - After treatment: expect visual field testing and ophthalmology follow-up soon post‑op and periodically thereafter; endocrine follow-up for hormone replacement or monitoring. Safety and lifestyle: - Avoid driving until your visual fields are reassessed and considered safe. - Report new or worsening headaches, vision loss, double vision, nausea, or unexplained fatigue immediately. If you have questions about MRI safety, medications, or the surgical process, ask your treating team; they can provide details tailored to your situation.
Referrals: Neurosurgery (for pituitary mass evaluation and management); Endocrinology (preoperative hormonal evaluation and postoperative follow-up)
Work Restrictions: Avoid driving; restriction from operating vehicles until vision and visual fields improve and are cleared by physician. Return-to-work limited from duties requiring safe driving, heavy machinery, or tasks needing full peripheral temporal visual fields; follow-up visual field testing before resuming such duties.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right occipital lobe infarction causing a dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia in a patient with vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) following recent coronary bypass surgery; retrochiasmal visual pathway lesion confirmed on visual field testing, no RAPD, visual acuity 20/20, recommend neuroimaging (MRI preferred), stroke risk factor control and antiplatelet therapy, and ophthalmic follow-up with repeat visual fields in ~6 months for recovery/rehabilitation evaluation (consider visual scanning training and prism/low-vision aids).
Primary Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarction causing a dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus; Hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarction (PCA stroke); optic radiation lesion (temporal/parietal lobe infarct or tumor); lateral geniculate body or optic tract lesion (infarct, tumor, demyelination)
Severity: Dense
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: aspirin (for stroke prophylaxis)
Follow-Up Instructions: Repeat visual fields and ophthalmologic examination approximately 6 months after onset to assess for improvement.
Patient Education: You have a left homonymous hemianopia — a loss of the left half of your visual field in both eyes caused by a stroke in the right occipital (vision) part of your brain. Your central vision and acuity are preserved, but you may “lose your place” when reading and miss objects on your left (e.g., bumping the left side of your car). Key points and practical steps: - Cause and prognosis: This is due to damage in the brain (not the eyes). Some recovery can occur over months, but many patients have persistent field loss. Control of stroke risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, quitting smoking) and taking recommended stroke-prevention medications (e.g., aspirin as advised) are essential to reduce further strokes. - Safety and daily strategies: Use a ruler or line guide when reading, turn your head and make deliberate large eye movements (scan) toward the left to bring items into your seeing field, and be cautious when driving — discuss driving restrictions with your physician and local licensing authority (most patients with this defect are not safe to drive). - Rehabilitation options: Visual scanning training and occupational therapy can improve scanning behaviors and function. Prism glasses can shift some images into your seeing field and may help in certain situations. Vision restoration therapies exist but have limited objective evidence. - Follow-up: Repeat visual field testing and ophthalmology/neurology follow-up at about 6 months to assess for improvement. Promptly report any new weakness, numbness, speech changes, sudden vision loss, or other neurologic symptoms. If you have questions about specific aids, driving, or rehabilitation referrals, ask your ophthalmologist or neurologist for individualized recommendations and referral to vision rehabilitation services.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 65-year-old woman with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presenting with three episodes of transient monocular visual loss of the right eye over 3 weeks, each lasting ~5–6 minutes, with funduscopic evidence of a cholesterol embolus (Hollenhorst plaque) in the right retinal arterioles. Examination notable for VA 20/25 OD, 20/20 OS, normal pupils, no RAPD, normal visual fields, mild bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts. Clinical impression: transient monocular visual loss due to retinal emboli most consistent with thromboembolic disease from ipsilateral carotid/aortic atherosclerotic source (retinal embolus secondary to right carotid stenosis favored). Recommend urgent vascular and cardiac evaluation (carotid duplex/MR angiography, consider conventional angiography as indicated; transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography), stroke risk factor optimization, and initiation of antiplatelet therapy unless a cardiac/aortic source or anticoagulation indication identified. If high-grade ipsilateral carotid stenosis (70–99%) and patient is a suitable surgical/stenting candidate, consider carotid endarterectomy or stenting. Consider ESR/CRP to exclude giant cell arteritis if clinical suspicion. Follow with periodic carotid surveillance.
Primary Diagnosis: Retinal emboli secondary to right carotid stenosis causing transient monocular visual loss
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Thromboembolic retinal ischemia from carotid/aortic atherosclerotic plaque (Hollenhorst plaque); Cardioembolic retinal embolism (valvular disease, atrial fibrillation); Giant cell arteritis; Ocular hypoperfusion (ocular ischemic syndrome/venous stasis retinopathy)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Stroke


Plan
All Medications: antihypertensive medication (unspecified), lipid-lowering medication (unspecified), aspirin (antiplatelet therapy suggested)
All Procedures: Carotid Doppler/ultrasound; MR angiography of carotid vessels; Conventional (catheter) angiography; Transthoracic echocardiography; Transesophageal echocardiography; Cardiac MR imaging; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C‑reactive protein (CRP) testing; Ophthalmodynamometry; MR brain with MR angiography; Carotid endarterectomy; Carotid stenting; Periodic noninvasive carotid surveillance (carotid Doppler or MR angiography)
Follow-Up Instructions: Medical supervision of stroke risk factors with periodic reevaluation of the carotid artery for restenosis using noninvasive studies (e.g., carotid Doppler or MR angiography).
Patient Education: You had brief episodes of vision “graying out” in your right eye caused by tiny cholesterol plaque (Hollenhorst plaque) seen in a retinal artery. This most commonly comes from atherosclerotic disease in the carotid arteries or heart and can increase your risk of stroke. Recommended steps: - Urgent vascular and cardiac evaluation (carotid imaging such as carotid Doppler/CTA/MRA; echocardiogram) to find the source of emboli. - Control vascular risk factors: strict blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking cessation, and diabetes management if present. - Antiplatelet therapy (usually aspirin) unless another indication requires anticoagulation — your doctor will decide. - If significant ipsilateral carotid stenosis is found (typically 70–99%), carotid endarterectomy or stenting may be recommended after specialist review. - If age >55 and symptoms or labs suggest giant cell arteritis (new headaches, jaw claudication, high ESR/CRP), urgent evaluation and treatment are needed. - Seek immediate care for any new or prolonged vision loss, weakness, speech changes, or other stroke-like symptoms. Follow-up with neurology, vascular surgery, and cardiology as arranged; regular monitoring of carotid status with noninvasive imaging.
Referrals: Carotid vascular evaluation (vascular surgery or stroke/neurology); cardiology (echocardiography and cardiac source evaluation); rheumatology or internal medicine for giant cell arteritis workup if indicated (ESR/CRP); hematology/coagulation if hypercoagulable workup indicated.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 70-year-old man with a 4-week history of binocular diplopia and recent onset right eyelid droop. Exam: visual acuity 20/30 OD, 20/25 OS; pupils 3 mm bilaterally, reactive to light and near; no RAPD. Complete right ptosis with poor levator function. Right eye: complete loss of adduction, elevation, and depression with intact abduction; mild incyclodeviation on attempted depression. Left motility normal. Mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. No proptosis, normal facial sensation and neurologic exam. Findings are consistent with an isolated, pupil-sparing, complete right third nerve palsy most consistent with ischemic etiology in the setting of diabetes and hypertension. Plan: control vasculopathic risk factors, observe with follow-up at 1–2 months for improvement (expect recovery over 3–6 months); obtain neuroimaging only if no improvement by 3 months or if pupils become involved or other neurologic signs develop. Consider Tensilon testing if fluctuating weakness suggestive of myasthenia gravis and consider strabismus or lid surgery for persistent deficits.
Primary Diagnosis: Ischemic isolated third nerve palsy
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus; Mild bilateral diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy; Posterior chamber intraocular lenses (status post bilateral cataract extraction); History of smoking (tobacco use)
Differential Diagnosis: Ischemic (microvascular) third nerve palsy (diabetic/vasculopathic); Compressive third nerve palsy (posterior communicating artery aneurysm or tumor); Myasthenia gravis; Giant cell arteritis
Severity: Complete
Laterality: Right


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow at 1– to 2‑month intervals to monitor for improvement; expect resolution in 3–6 months. If no improvement by 3 months, obtain neuroimaging to evaluate for a compressive lesion.
Patient Education: This is most likely an ischemic (diabetic/vascular) third nerve palsy causing your drooping eyelid and double vision. Control vascular risk factors—tightly manage blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol and stop smoking. Expect gradual improvement over 3–6 months; follow-up visits every 1–2 months to monitor recovery. If symptoms worsen (new pupil dilation, increasing pain, new neurological signs) or do not begin to improve by ~12 weeks, further testing (neuroimaging) is recommended. If diplopia or ptosis remain after recovery, surgical options for the eyelid or strabismus can be considered. If you develop symptoms suggestive of giant cell arteritis (new persistent headache, jaw or tongue claudication, scalp tenderness, sudden vision loss), seek immediate evaluation.
Referrals: Neuroimaging if no improvement by 3 months (or earlier if atypical features) — consider MRI/MRA or CT/CTA; ESR and CRP (and temporal artery biopsy if elevated/suspicious for GCA); Tensilon test for suspected myasthenia gravis.

====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Acute onset binocular diplopia, left-sided frontal-periorbital pain, and left lid droop
DURATION: 8 days
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I noted the acute onset of binocular diplopia 8 days ago. I had sudden left-sided frontal-periorbital pain, then noticed diplopia and left-sided lid droop."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 45-year-old man with acute onset 8 days earlier of binocular diplopia preceded by left-sided frontal–periorbital pain, who developed left-sided lid droop and progressive eye misalignment; exam showed left ptosis, anisocoria with a larger left pupil and minimal left pupil reaction, partial paresis of elevation, adduction, and depression of the left eye, and otherwise normal vision and neurologic exam.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old man noted the acute onset of binocular diplopia 8 days prior to evaluation. He experienced acute left-sided frontal–periorbital pain followed by left-sided lid droop and diplopia. He was previously well with no history of significant illnesses. Examination showed visual acuity 20/20 OU, pupils 3 mm OD and 5 mm OS in light (4 mm OD and 5 mm OS in dark) with the left pupil reacting minimally to light and near, no RAPD, and full confrontation fields. Ocular motility revealed mild left hypotropia and moderate exotropia with normal ductions OD and partial paresis of elevation, adduction, and depression OS. There was 3 mm left ptosis with mildly impaired levator function. Facial sensation and strength were normal with intact corneal reflexes bilaterally. Slit-lamp and fundus exams were normal, and general neurologic exam was otherwise normal. CT/CTA, MRI/MRA, and cerebral angiography demonstrated an ipsilateral posterior communicating artery aneurysm.
Symptom Onset: 8 days prior to evaluation
Symptom Duration: 8 days
Progression: Acute (onset 8 days prior)
Characteristics: Acute onset binocular diplopia, left frontal-periorbital pain, left ptosis, anisocoria with left pupil larger and minimally reactive, partial left CN III palsy (impaired elevation, adduction, depression), pupil-involving third nerve palsy due to ipsilateral posterior communicating artery aneurysm

Assessment Narrative: Partial left third nerve palsy with pupillary involvement secondary to a left posterior communicating artery aneurysm confirmed on CT/CTA, MRI/MRA and cerebral angiography; presenting with acute binocular diplopia, left ptosis, anisocoria (left pupil larger and minimally reactive), and partial paresis of elevation, adduction, and depression of the left eye.
Primary Diagnosis: Partial third nerve palsy due to posterior communicating artery aneurysm
Secondary Diagnoses: Posterior communicating artery aneurysm
Differential Diagnosis: Posterior communicating artery aneurysm compressive third nerve palsy; Diabetic ischemic (microvascular) third nerve palsy; Intracranial mass lesion (tumor) affecting the oculomotor nerve; Meningeal infiltration (e.g., carcinomatosis, meningitis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Aneurysmal rupture with subarachnoid hemorrhage leading to high morbidity and mortality


Plan
All Procedures: CT/CTA, MRI, MRA, cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA), surgical or endovascular repair of posterior communicating artery aneurysm (recommended)
Follow-Up Instructions: Patching the eye to relieve diplopia; surgical or endovascular repair of the posterior communicating artery aneurysm with neurosurgical/neuroradiologic follow-up and postprocedural ophthalmic monitoring.
Patient Education: You have a partial third nerve palsy caused by an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery. This aneurysm can press on the nerve and affect eyelid position, eye movements, and the pupil, and it can rupture with serious, potentially life‑threatening consequences. Treatment (surgical clipping or endovascular repair) is recommended to prevent rupture. Imaging tests (CT/CTA, MRI/MRA, and often cerebral angiography) are used to confirm and fully evaluate the aneurysm. In the short term, patching one eye can relieve your double vision. Report any sudden worsening of headache, sudden severe pain around the eye, sudden worsening of vision, new weakness, numbness, altered consciousness, or vomiting immediately to emergency services. Follow closely with neurosurgery/neuroradiology and neuro‑ophthalmology for definitive treatment planning and postoperative visual follow‑up.
Referrals: Neurosurgery / Endovascular neurosurgery for aneurysm repair and cerebral angiography consideration
Emergency Instructions: Surgery or endovascular therapy to repair the aneurysm is necessary to prevent aneurysmal rupture, which carries a high morbidity and mortality.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Decompensation of a longstanding congenital right fourth cranial nerve palsy (right superior oblique paresis) presenting with a right hypertropia worse on left gaze and right head tilt, 4° right excyclotropia, large vertical fusional amplitudes (10 PD), and chronic head tilt — consistent with congenital right FNP with recent symptomatic decompensation.
Primary Diagnosis: Decompensation of old right fourth cranial nerve palsy
Secondary Diagnoses: Congenital right fourth nerve palsy (decompensated)
Differential Diagnosis: Right superior oblique (fourth nerve) palsy; decompensated congenital fourth nerve palsy; myasthenia gravis; thyroid eye disease
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Procedures: Observation; prism correction; strabismus surgery
Follow-Up Instructions: No rehabilitation and follow-up are required if the problem is resolved.
Patient Education: Observation and reassurance that this is a longstanding (congenital) fourth nerve palsy that recently decompensated. Explain why the head tilt developed and how large vertical fusional amplitudes allowed compensation for years. Discuss treatment options: observation if symptoms mild, prism glasses to relieve diplopia, or strabismus surgery if prisms ineffective or misalignment cosmetically or functionally significant. Advise to return sooner if sudden worsening, new double vision, pain, numbness, drooping, or other neurologic symptoms occur. Offer referral to orthoptics for prism fitting and to strabismus surgeon for surgical discussion as needed.


CASE 69 — Sixth Nerve Palsy
===========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Binocular horizontal diplopia for 3 months, primarily at distance and worse on left gaze.
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have had binocular double vision for 3 months, mostly when looking at things far away and worse when I look to the left. It goes away when I look at things up close."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 56-year-old man with a 3-month history of binocular horizontal diplopia, primarily at distance and absent at near, worse on left gaze; associated mild left frontotemporal headaches and numbness/tingling of the left forehead. Symptoms worse on left gaze; no visual loss, trauma, or prior neurologic/ophthalmologic symptoms. Has type II diabetes controlled with oral agents.
History Narrative: A 56-year-old man with type II diabetes controlled on oral agents presented with a 3-month history of binocular horizontal diplopia, primarily at distance and absent at near, worse on left gaze. He also reported numbness and tingling in the left forehead and mild left frontotemporal headaches. He denied recent head trauma, visual loss, or prior neurologic/ophthalmologic symptoms. Examination showed 20/20 OU visual acuity, full color plates, pupils 4 mm equal and reactive, no RAPD, full confrontational fields, a 4 PD esotropia at distance and no esotropia at near (nil on right gaze, 8 PD on left gaze, 4 PD on up and down gaze), underaction of left eye abduction, no ptosis, decreased soft-touch sensation over the left forehead with slightly depressed left corneal reflex, normal slit-lamp and fundus exam without papilledema, and otherwise normal neurologic exam. MRI with contrast revealed a cavernous sinus meningioma causing a left sixth nerve palsy with involvement of the left ophthalmic (V1) branch of the trigeminal nerve.
Symptom Onset: 3 months ago
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Progressive over 3 months (worsening on left gaze)
Characteristics: Horizontal diplopia primarily at distance, worse on left gaze, 4 PD esotropia at distance (no ET at near), left abduction limitation consistent with left sixth nerve palsy, associated left V1 sensory loss and mild left frontotemporal headache.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: left gaze
Alleviating Factors: absent at near
Associated Symptoms: Binocular horizontal diplopia (worse on left gaze), numbness and tingling in the left forehead, mild left frontotemporal headaches, decreased sensation to soft touch over the left forehead, slightly depressed left corneal reflex.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Left sixth nerve palsy with underaction of left lateral rectus causing 4 PD esotropia at distance (worse on left gaze to 8 PD; none at near), accompanied by decreased sensation in the left forehead and mildly depressed left corneal reflex, consistent with involvement of the left ophthalmic (V1) branch of the trigeminal nerve. MRI with contrast demonstrated a cavernous sinus meningioma causing compressive left sixth nerve palsy and trigeminal neuropathy. Visual acuity 20/20 OU, pupils equal and reactive, no RAPD, full confrontation fields, no papilledema. Plan: treat underlying lesion (neurosurgical/radiation referral), symptomatic diplopia management (patching, prisms, consider early ipsilateral medial rectus botulinum injection), and close neurologic/ophthalmic follow-up; strabismus surgery if residual stable diplopia persists.
Primary Diagnosis: Left sixth nerve palsy
Secondary Diagnoses: Type II diabetes mellitus; trigeminal (V1) neuropathy (left forehead sensory loss)
Differential Diagnosis: Sixth nerve palsy due to cavernous sinus lesion (meningioma/other compressive tumor); Ischemic (vasculopathic) sixth nerve palsy; Cavernous sinus processes (thrombosis, fistula, aneurysm, inflammatory/infectious); Myasthenia gravis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: diplopia (persistent binocular horizontal diplopia), limitation of abduction (left lateral rectus paresis), decreased corneal reflex (risk of corneal exposure/keratopathy), residual ophthalmoplegia requiring strabismus surgery, potential recurrence or progression of neurologic deficits from cavernous sinus meningioma


Plan
All Medications: oral agents for diabetes
All Procedures: MRI with contrast; lumbar puncture (in some cases); spinal tap; patching; prisms; botulinum injection into ipsilateral medial rectus; strabismus surgery; surgery or radiation therapy for underlying lesion
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe for recurrence of further neurologic and ophthalmologic deficits depending on the etiology; provide symptomatic diplopia treatment (patching, prisms, or botulinum and consider strabismus surgery if chronic/stable); monitor for improvement and pursue neuroimaging or further evaluation if progressive or unresolved.
Patient Education: You have a left sixth (abducens) nerve palsy causing double vision, most likely due to a meningioma in the cavernous sinus pressing on nearby nerves. This explains your horizontal double vision (worse when looking left and at distance) and decreased sensation on the left forehead. Further evaluation with MRI with contrast is important to confirm the diagnosis and to plan treatment. Treatment targets the underlying lesion and may include observation, surgery, or radiation; diplopia can be managed temporarily with an eye patch, prism glasses, or botulinum injection into the opposing muscle, and strabismus surgery can be considered if weakness persists. Report any new symptoms (worsening vision, increased double vision, new numbness, weakness, severe headache, or vomiting) promptly. Follow-up visits are needed to monitor neurologic signs and eye alignment.
Referrals: Neuroimaging (MRI with contrast) and neurosurgery/neurology consultation (for cavernous sinus meningioma evaluation and management)


CASE 70 — Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia
======================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: difficulty focusing
DURATION: several months
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "difficulty focusing"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 27-year-old woman with known multiple sclerosis and prior right optic neuritis not on medications who for several months has had “difficulty focusing” her eyes. She reports no current medications; associated history includes mild gait instability, bladder disturbance, and leg numbness. On exam vision 20/20 OU with reduced color vision and a small paracentral scotoma on the right, a mild right afferent pupillary defect and mild temporal pallor of the right optic nerve; ocular signs began several months ago and consist of mild left adduction deficit with slow adducting saccades, right abducting monocular nystagmus, intact convergence, and a 2 PD comitant left hypertropia (skew deviation). No ptosis; slit-lamp otherwise normal.
History Narrative: A 27-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) complained of “difficulty focusing” her eyes. Her previous MS course included a history of optic neuritis in the right eye. She did have mild gait instability, bladder disturbance, and leg numbness. Her eye difficulty started several months prior to ophthalmologic evaluation. She was taking no medications.
Symptom Onset: several months prior to ophthalmologic evaluation
Symptom Duration: several months prior to ophthalmologic evaluation
Progression: Chronic (started several months prior; stable to chronic course)
Characteristics: Left internuclear ophthalmoplegia: mild left adduction deficit with slow adducting saccades, right-beating abducting nystagmus, intact convergence, comitant 2 prism diopter left hypertropia (skew), full ductions otherwise, no ptosis.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Horizontal gaze (rightward) — attempted rightward saccades exacerbate adduction weakness and elicit abducting nystagmus (i.e., horizontal gaze/attempted rightward saccades)
Alleviating Factors: Convergence (able to overcome the adduction deficit)
Associated Symptoms: difficulty focusing, mild gait instability, bladder disturbance, leg numbness, diplopia (intermittent/possible), oscillopsia
Previous Episodes: Optic neuritis in the right eye (prior episode of optic neuritis).
Prior Treatments: None
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild — patient reports “difficulty focusing” but has 20/20 acuity, no major functional impairment; possible intermittent diplopia/oscillopsia that may mildly affect reading or tasks requiring precise binocular vision.
Systemic Symptoms: mild gait instability, bladder disturbance, leg numbness
Risk Factors: Multiple sclerosis (history of MS), prior optic neuritis, age 27, neurological symptoms (gait instability, bladder disturbance), prior demyelinating disease — autoimmune demyelinating disease (MS) as primary risk factor.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 27-year-old woman with known multiple sclerosis presenting with several months of “difficulty focusing.” Examination: VA 20/20 OU, color vision 7/10 OD and 10/10 OS, small right paracentral scotoma, pupils 5 mm equal with mild right afferent pupillary defect, mild temporal pallor OD. Ocular motility: mild left adduction paresis with slowed adducting saccades, right abducting monocular nystagmus on dextroversion, intact convergence, and a comitant 2 PD left hypertropia consistent with a skew deviation. Findings consistent with a left internuclear ophthalmoplegia due to a lesion of the left medial longitudinal fasciculus in the setting of MS; right optic neuropathy is likely prior optic neuritis. Management directed at underlying MS; symptomatic diplopia from skew may be treated with prisms, with strabismus surgery considered only for persistent residual diplopia. Follow-up to monitor resolution recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Optic neuropathy (right) and left internuclear ophthalmoplegia due to multiple sclerosis
Secondary Diagnoses: Multiple sclerosis; Right optic neuritis; Mild gait instability; Bladder disturbance; Leg numbness; Right optic neuropathy (residual optic neuritis)
Differential Diagnosis: Left internuclear ophthalmoplegia due to multiple sclerosis; brainstem (pontine/midbrain) infarction; myasthenia gravis (pseudo-INO)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left
Complications: diplopia (due to skew deviation)


Plan
All Medications: None
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for resolution of the INO is important.
Patient Education: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is caused by a small lesion in the brainstem (medial longitudinal fasciculus) often from multiple sclerosis; it produces difficulty moving one eye inward with involuntary jerking of the other eye on outward gaze and may cause double vision. Your vision and color testing indicate prior right optic neuritis related to MS. Treatment targets the underlying cause (MS); many INOs improve over time. Measures to help now: use a prism in glasses for symptomatic vertical or horizontal diplopia, patch one eye or use an eye shield for bothersome double vision, and avoid driving if diplopia or imbalance impair safety. If your symptoms change, worsen, or you develop new weakness, numbness, severe headache, fever, or vision loss, seek prompt medical evaluation. Follow up with your neurologist and neuro‑ophthalmologist for MRI as indicated, monitoring, and management of MS (disease‑modifying therapy discussion) and consider vision rehabilitation if diplopia persists.


CASE 71 — Diplopia—Ocular Myasthenia Gravis
===========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Intermittent diplopia for 6 months, worse as the day goes on, with intermittent eyelid droop
DURATION: 6 months
LATERALITY: bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "two lines instead of one"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 57‑year‑old woman with a 6‑month history of intermittent diplopia that is minimal on waking but worsens as the day progresses, often causing double vision while driving (“two lines instead of one”); intermittent left or right eyelid droop; no headache, facial numbness/pain, dysphagia, dysarthria, breathing difficulty, or generalized weakness; history of pernicious anemia on monthly B12.
History Narrative: A 57-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of intermittent diplopia that was often absent on awakening but worsened as the day progressed. She reported seeing “two lines instead of one” while driving and had intermittent unilateral (left or right) eyelid droop. She denied headache, facial numbness or pain, dysphagia, dysarthria, breathing difficulty, generalized muscle weakness, or sensory deficits. Past medical history was notable only for pernicious anemia treated with monthly B12 injections. On examination pupils were 5 mm and reactive, visual afferent testing was normal, and there was an esotropia of 10 PD in primary position increasing with lateral gaze. Sustained lateral gaze worsened her diplopia and esotropia; duction testing suggested bilateral lateral rectus paresis. She had bilateral, mildly weak levator function with ptosis that worsened when the opposite lid was elevated (enhanced ptosis), and on prolonged upgaze developed a left hypertropia. Mild orbicularis/eye-closure weakness was present. Slit-lamp, fundus exam, thyroid testing, and chest CT were unremarkable. A Tensilon (edrophonium) test produced improvement of esotropia and ptosis; serum acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative. Findings were consistent with ocular myasthenia gravis.
Symptom Onset: 6 months ago
Symptom Duration: 6 months
Progression: Ocular myasthenia gravis with symptoms progressive over 6 months, fluctuating/worsening throughout each day and with sustained gaze; potential to generalize (risk ~50% to 80% over time) but currently ocular only.
Characteristics: Intermittent, fatigable diplopia and bilateral ptosis that worsen as the day progresses; ocular-only weakness of extraocular muscles (bilateral lateral rectus paresis) with orbicularis oculi weakness, enhanced ptosis, pupil-sparing, Tensilon-positive, AChR-antibody–negative, chest CT negative for thymoma


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Worsening as the day goes on (fatigue with sustained use); prolonged upward gaze; sustained lateral gaze; elevation of body temperature
Alleviating Factors: Symptoms improved by rest and by edrophonium (Tensilon) test; often better on awakening and improved by cold (ice-pack test)
Associated Symptoms: Intermittent diplopia worsening with fatigue over the day, intermittent unilateral eyelid droop (ptosis), increased ptosis with elevation of opposite eyelid (enhanced ptosis), difficulty driving (seeing two lines), worsened diplopia with sustained lateral gaze, mild orbicularis oculi/eye closure weakness, no headache, facial numbness or pain, dysphagia, dysarthria, breathing difficulty, or generalized muscle weakness.
Previous Episodes: Intermittent diplopia for 6 months, with intermittent eyelid droop during that period
Prior Treatments: Vitamin B12 injections monthly for pernicious anemia.
Impact on Daily Activities: Difficulty driving due to worsening diplopia (seeing “two lines instead of one” in the middle of the road); intermittent functional impairment with activities that require sustained gaze as symptoms worsen through the day.
Systemic Symptoms: No systemic symptoms reported (denies headache, facial numbness or pain, dysphagia, dysarthria, breathing difficulty, generalized muscle weakness, or extremity paresis or sensory symptoms)
Risk Factors: Age (57 years), female sex, pernicious anemia (autoimmune disease)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Ocular myasthenia gravis presenting with fluctuating, fatigable binocular diplopia and bilateral ptosis. Examination notable for esotropia increasing on lateral gaze (10 PD primary, up to 18 PD), paresis of both lateral rectus muscles, bilateral mild levator weakness with enhanced ptosis, and mild orbicularis oculi/eyelid closure weakness. Pupils normal, no afferent defect, slit-lamp and fundus exams normal, and general neurologic exam otherwise unremarkable. Tensilon test produced improvement of esotropia and ptosis. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies negative, TSH normal, and chest CT without thymoma. Findings consistent with ocular myasthenia gravis.
Primary Diagnosis: Ocular myasthenia gravis
Secondary Diagnoses: Pernicious anemia
Differential Diagnosis: Myasthenia gravis (ocular); Bilateral sixth nerve palsies; Ocular myopathy; Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: B12 (monthly injections), edrophonium (Tensilon), neostigmine (Prostigmin), pyridostigmine (Mestinon), prednisone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis.
All Procedures: Tensilon (edrophonium) test Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest
Follow-Up Instructions: Close supervision of medications; inform physician immediately if dysphagia, respiratory difficulty, or limb weakness develop; periodic reassessment for generalization of myasthenia and medication adjustment.
Patient Education: Explain ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) as an autoimmune condition causing weakness and fatigue of the eyelid and eye‑movement muscles that typically worsens through the day and improves with rest. Review the specific findings in this case (intermittent double vision, fluctuating drooping eyelids, improvement with edrophonium/Tensilon, negative AChR antibodies, normal chest CT). Teach warning signs that require immediate medical attention: new or worsening difficulty breathing, swallowing, speaking, or limb weakness (possible generalization). Discuss home measures: use rest breaks, avoid overheating, consider ice‑pack test for ptosis, and use patching or prism/eye patching while driving to manage diplopia temporarily. Explain treatment options and rationale: symptomatic anticholinesterase (pyridostigmine) for eyelid/eye muscle weakness, corticosteroids or other immunosuppression if symptoms are significant or refractory, and that thymoma was not seen on her chest CT so thymectomy is not indicated now. Discuss possible course: some patients remain ocular, others may develop generalized MG within 2–3 years, and follow‑up with neurology/oculoplastics is important. Arrange follow‑up: prompt neurologic/neuromuscular clinic referral if not already, periodic rechecks of ocular findings and strength, and repeat testing (single‑fiber EMG or antibody panels) if diagnosis remains uncertain. Advise medication precautions and interactions; carry a medical alert card noting MG and current medications, and inform all treating clinicians and dentists. Provide resources for patient education and support (MG patient organizations) and encourage questions.
Emergency Instructions: Inform physician immediately if you develop dysphagia, respiratory difficulty, or limb weakness.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 35-year-old woman with history of hyperthyroidism treated with radioactive iodine 1 year ago presenting with 2 months of bilateral eye irritation, constant binocular vertical diplopia, and progressive proptosis. Exam: VA 20/25 OU, full color vision, pupils equal and reactive, no RAPD, full static fields. Motility: left hypertropia 4 PD primary, increases on up and down gaze, esotropia 5 PD comitant; ductions show limitation of elevation and depression OU and limitation of abduction OU (worse OS), consistent with restrictive extraocular myopathy. Lid retraction and lid lag bilaterally. Proptosis with Hertel 22 mm OD and 24 mm OS (base 95 mm). Mild punctate keratopathy OU; fundi normal. Clinical picture most consistent with thyroid orbitopathy (Graves’ ophthalmopathy) with restrictive EOM involvement and mild exposure keratopathy. Recommend thyroid function assessment, imaging of orbits (CT/MRI) to document EOM enlargement, smoking cessation, lubrication for exposure, consider prisms/patching for diplopia, and close follow-up for progression; systemic corticosteroids or orbital radiation reserved if active inflammation worsens or optic neuropathy/severe exposure develops. Further interventions (orbital decompression, strabismus and lid surgery) to be considered in chronic stable phase.
Primary Diagnosis: Thyroid orbitopathy
Secondary Diagnoses: Hyperthyroidism (history of), treated with radioactive iodine; Dry eye (exposure keratopathy / punctate keratopathy)
Differential Diagnosis: Thyroid orbitopathy (Graves’ ophthalmopathy); orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation); myasthenia gravis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Exposure keratopathy; diplopia (restrictive extraocular myopathy); optic neuropathy from compressive apical crowding; cosmetic disfigurement (proptosis, lid retraction); vision loss from corneal breakdown or optic nerve compression


Plan
All Medications: thyroid supplements; methylcellulose artificial tears; ophthalmic ointment; systemic corticosteroids (as possible treatment); orbital radiation (not a medication)
Follow-Up Instructions: Close ophthalmologic supervision with regular monitoring of visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and fundus for signs of optic neuropathy; monitor corneal status for epithelial breakdown and treat promptly (e.g., tarsorrhaphy if severe); coordinate care with endocrinology and other specialists; observe throughout active inflammatory period with follow-up visits until stabilization and during chronic phase for potential surgical planning.
Patient Education: Stop smoking; maintain thyroid treatment and follow endocrinology. Use lubricating artificial tears during the day and ointment at night; tape lids or use humidified goggles at night if exposure; elevate head of bed and sleep partially upright. Wear dark glasses for photophobia. For diplopia, patch one eye or use prisms as needed. Seek urgent care for severe exposure keratopathy, worsening vision, or signs of optic neuropathy. Follow regularly with ophthalmology for monitoring during active disease.
Referrals: Endocrinology (thyroid management) and ophthalmology (orbital/strabismus specialist); multidisciplinary team including oculoplastics and possible neuro-ophthalmology as needed.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmology care for severe exposure keratopathy, severe proptosis or globe luxation, sudden vision decrease, signs of optic neuropathy (worsening visual acuity, color vision loss, new visual field defects), or severe orbital pain—these require prompt aggressive therapy (e.g., high‑dose steroids, orbital decompression, or radiation).


CASE 73 — Anisocoria—Tonic Pupil
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Anisocoria
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "it could be due to a brain tumor."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 45‑year‑old woman noted to have one pupil larger than the other by a friend at a cocktail party 2 weeks earlier; she denied eye pain, visual symptoms, eye drop use, head or eye trauma, and other illnesses, had occasional headaches for several years, and sought evaluation including a normal brain MRI by a neurosurgeon.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old woman was evaluated for anisocoria after a friend noted one pupil larger than the other at a cocktail party 2 weeks earlier. She complained of occasional headaches over several years but denied other illnesses, significant head or eye trauma, use of any eye drops, or any visual symptoms. A neurosurgeon obtained a normal brain MRI and suggested she might need a cerebral angiogram. On exam visual acuity was 20/20 OU, color vision and visual fields were normal. In darkness the right pupil measured 6 mm and the left 3 mm. The right pupil reacted poorly and segmentally to light and showed vermiform movements of one iris sector on slit‑lamp exam; it slowly constricted to near and slowly redilated on distance fixation. The left pupil reacted briskly and symmetrically to light and constricted briskly to near with quick redilation at distance. Motility was normal and there was no ptosis. Fundus exam was normal.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks ago
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Characteristics: Poor pupillary light reaction; vermiform (segmental) iris movements to light; segmental sphincter palsy; tonic near response with light–near dissociation; cholinergic supersensitivity to dilute pilocarpine; accommodative paresis (with possible induced near astigmatism and ciliary cramp).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Isolated, idiopathic tonic (Adie’s) pupil of the right eye causing anisocoria with light-near dissociation and segmental vermiform iris movements; no treatment required other than reassurance and follow-up.
Primary Diagnosis: Isolated, idiopathic tonic pupil
Secondary Diagnoses: Anisocoria; Tonic pupil (Adie’s pupil)
Differential Diagnosis: Third cranial nerve palsy; Pharmacologic mydriasis; Tonic (Adie’s) pupil; Iris structural damage
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: Pilocarpine (0.125%), Pilocarpine 1%
Follow-Up Instructions: No treatment other than reassurance; consider unequal bifocal or unilateral frosted bifocal for near tasks if accommodative paresis persists. Reexamine periodically — note that pupil may shrink over time and fellow eye may become involved (~4%/yr). If bilateral pupils develop, obtain serologic testing for syphilis.
Patient Education: This is an isolated (idiopathic) tonic (Adie’s) pupil: a benign cause of one dilated pupil due to loss of parasympathetic input to the iris. It commonly causes a poor light response, slow near response, and sometimes mild difficulty with focusing or glare. No treatment is usually required—reassurance is appropriate. Reading aids (unequal bifocals or a frosted segment) can be used if near vision is bothersome. The affected pupil often improves or becomes smaller over time; rarely the other eye can become involved. If symptoms change (pain, double vision, drooping eyelid, sudden vision loss) or new systemic symptoms occur (fainting, numbness), seek prompt medical evaluation.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 50-year-old man with 3 weeks of left frontotemporal/periorbital headache and 2 mm left ptosis. Visual acuity 20/20 OU, color vision normal, pupils 4 mm OD and 3 mm OS in light, 5 mm OD and 3 mm OS in dark; pupils react to light and near, no RAPD. Cocaine 10%: marked dilation OD, poor dilation OS, confirming Horner syndrome. Hydroxyamphetamine 1%: full dilation OD, poor dilation OS, localizing to a postganglionic (third-order) Horner syndrome. MR angiography showed a dissecting aneurysm of the high cervical internal carotid artery. Diagnosis: postganglionic Horner syndrome due to spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection. Managed with anticoagulation (3 months of warfarin) then aspirin; no surgical intervention indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Postganglionic Horner’s syndrome due to spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Horner’s syndrome (postganglionic due to internal carotid artery dissection); Physiologic anisocoria (pseudo‑Horner’s from levator dehiscence); Cavernous sinus process (thrombosis, tumor, or infection)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: hydroxyamphetamine 1% (Paredrine); topical cocaine 10%; Coumadin (warfarin) for 3 months; aspirin
All Procedures: Topical cocaine 10% pupillary testing; Hydroxyamphetamine 1% (Paredrine) pupillary testing; MR angiography of the carotid artery; Anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin) for 3 months; Aspirin maintenance thereafter
Follow-Up Instructions: Close observation with serial evaluation to monitor for development of other neurologic or medical signs or symptoms; pursue appropriate imaging and specialist follow‑up as indicated by clinical course (e.g., repeat neuroimaging/vascular follow‑up for carotid pathology)
Patient Education: You have Horner’s syndrome from a tear (dissection) in the internal carotid artery on the left side. This causes a small pupil and mild drooping of the upper eyelid on that side and can be associated with head/neck pain. The eye problem itself usually does not require treatment, but the underlying carotid dissection is potentially serious because it can reduce blood flow to the brain or cause stroke. Typical care includes blood-thinning treatment (anticoagulation initially, often followed by antiplatelet therapy) and close follow-up with your vascular/neurology team and repeat imaging to make sure the artery heals. Watch for new symptoms — sudden weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, sudden vision loss, severe worsening headache, fainting, or new double vision — and seek emergency care if any occur. Keep scheduled follow-ups and imaging appointments, report new or worsening eye or neurologic symptoms promptly, and discuss activity restrictions and medication side effects (bleeding risk) with your treating physicians.

Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: headaches and anisocoria
DURATION: several years (worse over the last few months)
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "blurry"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 24-year-old student nurse with several years of daily, diffuse headaches that worsened over the past few months; associated longstanding blurred vision (worse with headaches); noted anisocoria by neurologist leading to ophthalmology referral; denies diplopia, nausea, vomiting; on medications only for headaches.
History Narrative: A 24-year-old student nurse was referred for long-standing headaches, blurred vision, and anisocoria.

Findings (8 mm right pupil, 4 mm left; right pupil nonreactive to light and near; normal motility, no ptosis, smooth round iris without segmental contraction; full visual acuity and fields; normal fundus) argue against third nerve palsy, tonic pupil, or iris damage. Pilocarpine testing showed no constriction, consistent with pharmacologic blockade. Recommend reassurance, counseling regarding possible exposures, and follow-up to document resolution.
Primary Diagnosis: Pharmacologic mydriasis
Differential Diagnosis: Right third nerve palsy; Tonic (Adie) pupil; Iris structural damage; Pharmacologic mydriasis
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: None


Plan
All Medications: medications only for her headaches
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up to ensure resolution of the symptoms.
Patient Education: Reassure that the enlarged, nonreactive pupil is due to medication exposure (pharmacologic mydriasis), not nerve damage; avoid touching eyes after handling eye-care products or medications that can dilate the pupil (eg, anticholinergics, decongestant sprays, scopolamine); expect gradual return to normal pupil size without treatment over days to weeks; seek follow-up if symptoms worsen, vision changes persist, new eyelid droop or double vision develop, or the pupil does not improve.
Work Restrictions: None (no restrictions)
Emergency Instructions: Return to clinic or emergency department if new neurologic symptoms develop (worsening headache, double vision, ptosis, weakness, numbness, or sudden vision loss). Otherwise no urgent treatment; follow-up to ensure pupil returns to normal.


CASE 76 — Leukocoria
====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Leukocoria
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "funny"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The family noted a white “funny” pupil in the left eye for 3 months in a previously healthy 9‑month‑old girl; born 2 weeks premature, birth weight 6 lb 8 oz. The pediatrician detected leukocoria and referred urgently. The child fixes and follows with the right eye but not the left and strongly objects to occlusion of the right eye. No other systemic symptoms, no systemic disease, no animal exposures, and no family history of childhood ocular disease.
History Narrative: The family of a 9-month-old girl noted that her left eye has looked “funny” for the last 3 months. The pediatrician detected leukocoria and immediately referred her to an ophthalmologist. The child is otherwise healthy with negative review of systems except for the white pupil. She was born 2 weeks prematurely with a birth weight of 6 lb., 8 oz. There is no history of systemic disease or animal exposure, and no family history of childhood ocular disease. On examination the right eye appeared normal though only the posterior pole could be seen on retinal exam. The left eye had an obvious white, vascular lesion with a large surrounding serous retinal detachment. The child fixes and follows well with her right eye but does not fix or follow with her left eye; strong objection to occlusion of the right eye was noted.
Symptom Onset: 3 months prior to presentation
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Progression: Bilateral retinoblastoma with left eye advanced (massive tumor with large serous retinal detachment and vitreous seeding) and smaller tumor in the right eye; left eye recommended for enucleation; right eye managed with medical/local therapy and close surveillance.
Characteristics: Bilateral retinoblastoma: left eye large vascular intraocular tumor with massive exudative/serous retinal detachment and vitreous seeding; right eye small inferior retinal tumor; leukocoria; patient 9‑month‑old, no family history; optic nerve tumor extension risk.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: White pupil (leukocoria), failure to fix or follow with left eye, strabismus (implied by objection to occlusion of right eye)
Previous Episodes: None
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant — monocular vision with loss of the left eye; impacts depth perception and may limit activities requiring binocular vision; requires protective measures and long‑term follow‑up.
Systemic Symptoms: Negative review of systems except for the white pupil (no systemic symptoms)
Recent Travel: No recent travel
Risk Factors: Hereditary RB1 gene mutation (possible given bilateral disease), prematurity (born 2 weeks early), family history negative (no family history) — main risk: germline RB1 mutation (hereditary retinoblastoma)

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Nasal and inferior peripheral retina of the left eye obscured by large vascular tumor with extensive serous (exudative) retinal detachment; small tumor in the inferior peripheral retina of the right eye.


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Bilateral retinoblastoma: large, vascular left intraocular mass with surrounding massive serous retinal detachment and vitreous seeding, and a smaller tumor in the inferior retina of the right eye. Left eye has no visual fixation and poor prognosis—recommend enucleation with long optic nerve segment to assess for optic nerve invasion. Right eye has smaller tumor amenable to focal and/or chemotherapy (systemic and/or intra-arterial/periocular/intravitreal as indicated) with close monitoring. MRI performed to evaluate for extraocular or CNS extension; genetic testing for RB1 germline mutation and counseling recommended. Close follow-up with examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months until age 5 (more frequently if germline mutation), long-term surveillance for secondary malignancies, and ocular prosthesis/monocular protection and rehabilitation planning.
Primary Diagnosis: Bilateral retinoblastoma
Differential Diagnosis: Retinoblastoma; Coats’ disease; Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV); Toxocariasis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Secondary malignancies (soft‑tissue and bony sarcomas), extraocular/orbital recurrence including optic nerve invasion and metastasis, vision loss/monocular vision, socket complications post‑enucleation, recurrence in contralateral eye, treatment‑related complications from chemotherapy/radiation (local tissue damage, vitreoretinal toxicity)


Plan
All Procedures: examination under anesthesia; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits; ultrasound (B‑scan and A‑scan); genetic testing/counseling for RB1; enucleation (left eye) with long optic nerve segment; chemotherapy (intravenous, intra‑arterial, periocular, intravitreal as indicated); focal therapies: laser therapy, cryotherapy, plaque (radiation) therapy; intravitreal chemotherapy; pathologic examination of enucleated eye
Follow-Up Instructions: - Examine enucleated socket at each visit when examining the contralateral eye. - If RB1 germline mutation present: EUA every 3–4 months until age 5, then continued frequent exams for several years and at least annual eye exams thereafter. - Monitor long-term for secondary malignancies (soft-tissue and bony sarcomas); provide long-term follow-up. - Protect remaining eye (polycarbonate safety glasses) and provide education on eye safety.
Patient Education: Urgent evaluation and treatment are needed for leukocoria because it can signal retinoblastoma, a potentially life‑threatening eye tumor. Recommended steps: exam under anesthesia and MRI of the brain and orbits to assess both eyes and look for extraocular or CNS disease; genetic testing for RB1 to guide prognosis, family screening, and surveillance. Treatment options include chemotherapy (intravenous, intra‑arterial, periocular, or intravitreal as indicated), focal therapies (laser, cryotherapy, plaque radiotherapy), or enucleation for an eye with extensive tumor and no visual potential. Follow‑up: frequent EUA and exams (every 3–4 months until age 5 if germline RB1 mutation, then continued periodic surveillance and annual exams thereafter) to monitor for recurrence and contralateral disease. Long‑term: patients with hereditary retinoblastoma have increased risk of secondary malignancies (especially sarcomas) and need lifelong surveillance; protect the seeing eye (polycarbonate safety glasses) and provide education on eye safety. Family members should be examined and offered genetic counseling/testing.
Referrals: Genetic counseling and testing; pediatric oncology for chemotherapy planning; oculoplastic/orbital surgeon for enucleation; pediatric radiology for MRI; ophthalmology for examination under anesthesia and long-term follow-up
Emergency Instructions: Urgent ophthalmologic evaluation (exam under anesthesia) and MRI of the head and orbits to assess for intraocular tumor extent and extraocular spread; prompt genetic testing and counseling; arrange oncology/retinoblastoma treatment (chemotherapy ± focal therapy or enucleation) and close follow-up with frequent EUA every 3–4 months if germline RB1 mutation.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Anisometropic amblyopia of the right eye due to uncorrected hyperopia (cycloplegic refraction +3.00 OD, +1.00 OS) with reduced best-recognized acuity OD (HOTV 20/50 OD vs 20/30 OS); orthotropia at distance, 4Δ exophoria at near; plan to initiate full (or symmetrically reduced) hyperopic spectacle correction, monitor for improvement, and institute amblyopia therapy (patching or atropine penalization) if acuity does not improve with glasses alone.
Primary Diagnosis: Anisometropic amblyopia in the right eye due to uncorrected hyperopia
Secondary Diagnoses: Anisometropia (hyperopic anisometropia: OD +3.00, OS +1.00)
Differential Diagnosis: Anisometropic (refractive) amblyopia; Strabismic amblyopia; Deprivational amblyopia (media opacity/ptosis); Poor effort/functional visual loss
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right eye


Plan
All Medications: 1% cyclopentolate; atropine (topical)
All Procedures: Cycloplegic refraction with 1% cyclopentolate Visual acuity testing (Allen figures, HOTV acuity, Titmus stereo) Ocular motility evaluation (ductions/versions, phoria assessment) Spectacle prescription/optical correction of hyperopia Atropine cycloplegia/optical penalization (medication instillation) Occlusion therapy (patching of sound eye) Follow-up ophthalmologic examinations
Follow-Up Instructions: Ophthalmologic follow-up examinations as needed to monitor vision and refractive error, with repeat visits several weeks to months after starting spectacles to assess for improvement; continue monitoring for recurrence (may require maintenance patching until age 7–8 years) and update prescriptions as the child’s refractive error changes.
Patient Education: Explain that the child’s poorer vision in the right eye is due to amblyopia from unequal farsightedness (anisometropic hyperopia). Treatment goals are to improve clarity in the affected eye and encourage use of that eye to restore vision during the critical period of visual development. Key points: - Full or slightly reduced glasses prescription will be provided to correct the refractive error; glasses may sometimes be started after a brief course of atropine to aid adaptation. - If vision does not improve adequately with glasses alone, patching the good eye for prescribed hours per day or pharmacologic penalization (atropine drops in the good eye) will be recommended to force use of the amblyopic eye. - Regular follow-up visits are essential to monitor vision, adjust glasses, and assess response to treatment; treatment often takes weeks to months. - Consistent adherence to glasses and patching/atropine is critical—partial or inconsistent use reduces the chance of improvement. - Vision improvements can be maintained but can relapse as the child grows; maintenance therapy and periodic refractions are needed until about age 7–8 years (or as advised). - Warn about possible patching side effects (skin irritation, initial resistance) and atropine effects (light sensitivity, temporary near blur) and provide strategies to improve cooperation (short, scheduled patching times, positive reinforcement, stickers, supervised activities). - Encourage eye-healthy behaviors: wearing prescribed glasses at all times, attending all follow-up appointments, and prompt reporting of any redness, pain, or vision change.


CASE 78 — Childhood Torticollis
===============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Anomalous left head tilt since infancy.
DURATION: Since infancy (since he first gained head control during the first year of life)
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 5-year-old boy with a lifelong, relatively constant left head tilt noted since infancy (since he gained head control in the first year of life), resistant to attempts to straighten it; over the past 2 months parents report intermittent episodes where his eyes do not move together; associated frequent eye rubbing and blinking; no neck muscle abnormalities on orthopedic evaluation; family history unremarkable.
History Narrative: A 5-year-old boy is brought to his ophthalmologist’s office at the request of his pediatrician for evaluation of an anomalous head tilt.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right superior oblique palsy with chronic left head tilt and mild facial asymmetry.
Primary Diagnosis: Right superior oblique palsy with chronic left head tilt and mild facial asymmetry
Differential Diagnosis: Superior oblique palsy; Brown’s syndrome; Dissociated vertical deviation; Sternocleidomastoid (nonocular) torticollis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Over- or under-correction after surgery with possible need for additional surgery - Development of postoperative Brown’s syndrome (limitation of elevation in adduction) - Amblyopia (preexisting or developing if misalignment persists) - Diplopia or persistent anomalous head posture if surgery unsuccessful


Plan
All Procedures: Inferior oblique myectomy or recession; superior oblique tuck; possible combination surgery on superior and inferior oblique and rectus muscles; vertical prism therapy (non-surgical)
Follow-Up Instructions: Periodic ophthalmologic evaluations with attention to fusion, stereopsis, and visual acuity to detect, prevent, and treat amblyopia; monitor for over- or under-correction after surgery and for postoperative Brown’s syndrome, with additional surgeries as needed.
Patient Education: The child’s head tilt is caused by a weakness of the right superior oblique eye muscle (a type of ocular torticollis). Because this likely developed early in life, it has caused the child to adopt a persistent left head tilt and mild facial asymmetry. Many children with mild superior oblique palsy do well without surgery because they can fuse and maintain single vision; if symptoms are minimal, no treatment may be needed. Small vertical prisms can help with minor vertical misalignment but are usually limited to about 4–5 prism diopters. Surgery is offered to improve head posture, fusion, or double vision and typically involves weakening the opposite (inferior oblique) muscle, tightening the superior oblique, or a combination; surgery may require future adjustments and can sometimes cause temporary limitation of upgaze in adduction (a Brown’s syndrome) that often improves over time. If onset is longstanding and congenital-appearing, neuroimaging is not usually required; if onset is unclear or suspected to be acquired, brain and orbital imaging should be obtained. After treatment, regular follow-up is important to monitor vision, binocular fusion, and to detect or treat amblyopia early.
Referrals: Neuroimaging of brain and orbit if acquired palsy suspected or timing unclear; pediatric orthopedics previously evaluated (no neck abnormality)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 11-week-old former 24-week EGA premature female with birth weight 650 g, currently intubated and on 50% oxygen with recent sepsis and NEC history, presenting with zone I retinopathy demonstrating posterior pole venous dilation and arteriolar tortuosity (plus disease) consistent with Type I ROP in both eyes. High risk for progression given extreme prematurity, low birth weight, and unstable clinical course; urgent treatment recommended (e.g., intravitreal anti-VEGF or laser photocoagulation) with close frequent follow-up for regression and possible reactivation.
Primary Diagnosis: Type I retinopathy of prematurity, bilateral
Secondary Diagnoses: Sepsis; Respiratory compromise requiring re-intubation/ventilatory support; Anemia of prematurity; Necrotizing enterocolitis (history)
Differential Diagnosis: Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy; Eales’ disease; Norrie disease
Severity: Type I ROP
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Retinal detachment; posterior retinal fold; cataract; subretinal hemorrhage; intraretinal hemorrhage; vitreous hemorrhage; severe myopia; amblyopia; strabismus; significant refractive errors (myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia)


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab, intravenous antibiotics
All Procedures: Retinopathy of prematurity screening examinations (indirect ophthalmoscopic retinal examinations with scleral depression as needed); retinal photographic screening (telemedicine); intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (anti–VEGF therapy); peripheral retinal photocoagulation (laser treatment); cryotherapy
Follow-Up Instructions: Examine frequently until disease regression; for bevacizumab-treated infants, continue screening up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age to monitor for late reactivation.
Patient Education: The infant has retinopathy of prematurity (Type I ROP) due to extreme prematurity and low birth weight. This can progress rapidly and may threaten vision; prompt treatment is recommended (laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti‑VEGF such as bevacizumab). Treatment often causes regression but may have risks (laser: cataract, hemorrhage, higher myopia; anti‑VEGF: unknown long‑term ocular/systemic effects and potential late reactivation). After treatment, frequent eye exams are required until full retinal vascularization (often up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age with anti‑VEGF). Premature infants remain at higher risk for amblyopia, strabismus, and significant refractive errors and will need long‑term ophthalmic follow‑up.
Referrals: Pediatric ophthalmology for urgent treatment (laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti‑VEGF) and ongoing ROP screening/follow‑up; neonatology for stabilization/oxygen management; pediatric infectious disease for sepsis management.

Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in a few months after prescribing new glasses with full cycloplegic refraction to recheck ocular alignment; monitor vision for amblyopia and adjust treatment as needed; perform regular follow-ups throughout childhood (intervals based on angle stability, visual acuity, and age) and consider surgery if residual deviation >10–12 PD at distance despite full correction.
Patient Education: New glasses with the full cycloplegic prescription to correct under‑treated hyperopia, with follow-up in a few months to reassess alignment and vision; possible bifocals if distance alignment is good but near esotropia persists and fusion/stereopsis are present; monitor and treat amblyopia as needed (occlusion therapy if indicated); if residual esotropia >10–12 prism diopters with full correction, discuss surgical options (medial rectus recession or other muscle procedures); regular follow-up throughout childhood to monitor alignment, visual acuity, and need for further treatment.


CASE 82 — Childhood Exotropia
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Intermittent drifting out of the right eye for 2 years, worse at distance and when tired (now outward ~60% of the day)
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: Right eye
PATIENT QUOTES: "drifting out of the right eye" "worse when ... tired or when he is looking at distant objects" "initially noted this deviation approximately two to three times a day" "now deviated outward approximately 60% of the day" "right eye closure in sunlight"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 4-year-old boy with a 2-year history of intermittent outward drifting of the right eye, initially occurring 2–3 times daily but recently worsening to about 60% of the day; worse when tired and when looking at distance, with right eye closure in sunlight; no trauma, fever, medical problems, or family history of strabismus/amblyopia.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Pseudodivergence excess type intermittent exotropia in a 4‑year‑old boy with a 2‑year history of intermittent right exotropia worse at distance, intermittently present ~60% of the day, 50Δ at distance and 25–45Δ at near (poorly controlled), full ductions/versions, visual acuity 20/30 OU, normal stereopsis (40″), no amblyopia, cycloplegic refraction +0.50 OD, +0.75 OS.
Primary Diagnosis: Pseudodivergence excess type intermittent exotropia
Differential Diagnosis: Intermittent exotropia (pseudodivergence-excess type); Basic exotropia; Sensory exotropia; Third nerve palsy
Severity: Moderate (intermittent exotropia ~50 PD distance, present ~60% of day, poor control)
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Recurrence of exotropia (20–40%); amblyopia; decreased stereopsis; cosmetic/psychosocial concerns; need for repeat surgery.


Plan
All Procedures: Titmus stereo fly test Alternate cover testing Patch test (20–45 minutes occlusion) 30-minute patch test Cycloplegic refraction Vision (visual acuity) testing Ductions and versions (ocular motility) examination Simultaneous prism and cover testing Overminus spectacle trial Alternate or dominant eye part-time occlusion (patching) Pencil pushup convergence exercises Computer orthoptic exercises Progressively increasing base-out prism therapy Bilateral lateral rectus recessions Lateral rectus recession with ipsilateral medial rectus resection Bilateral medial rectus resections
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up every 2–6 months while on medical management; if surgery performed, allow ~6 weeks for healing and continue long‑term follow‑up for recurrence and monitoring of stereopsis/amblyopia.
Patient Education: Intermittent exotropia is a common, lifelong condition where one eye sometimes drifts outward, often when tired or looking at distance. In your child’s case it’s worse at distance and classified as pseudodivergence excess intermittent exotropia. Key points: - Many children retain good vision and stereopsis; amblyopia is uncommon but will be monitored. - Non‑surgical options aim to improve control (reduce time eye is outward) and include observation, part‑time occlusion (patching), over‑minus glasses temporarily, and, when age/ability allow, convergence (orthoptic) exercises (e.g., pencil pushups). - Surgery is considered if control worsens (deviation present >40–50% of the day or poor control) and is typically delayed until around age 4 if control is adequate; procedures depend on the type of exotropia. - Regular follow‑up every 2–6 months while managed medically, and long‑term follow‑up after surgery, is important because recurrence can occur and vision/stereopsis can change. - Watch for signs of decreased vision, reduced depth perception, or increased frequency of the eye drifting; seek prompt re‑evaluation if these occur.


CASE 83 — Childhood Ptosis
==========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: droopy right upper lid
DURATION: Since birth
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "this right upper lid has been 'lazy' since birth" "he holds his chin up when he is walking or watching TV" "occasionally the child lets the lid block his pupil"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Right upper eyelid droop present since birth. Parents report he holds his chin up (about 15°) when walking or watching TV and occasionally lets the lid block his pupil. No noted ocular motility disturbance. No family history of ptosis, strabismus, or hereditary muscular disorders. Otherwise healthy and developing normally; review of systems negative.
History Narrative: A 17-month-old boy with a right upper lid that has been “lazy” since birth. Parents note a persistent chin-up posture when walking or watching TV (approximately 15°) and occasional obstruction of the pupil by the lid. No history of trauma, no family history of ptosis, strabismus, or hereditary muscular disorders. Otherwise healthy with normal development and a negative review of systems. Visual behavior shows good fixation and following in both eyes without a fixation preference. External exam notable for moderate to severe right upper lid ptosis present since birth. Interpalpebral fissure: right 6.5 mm, left 10 mm. Margin-reflex distance (MRD1) in primary position: right 0.5 mm, left 3.5 mm; with chin-up posture MRD1: right 2 mm, left 3 mm. Levator function: right 6 mm, left 12 mm. No appreciable lid crease on the right. Pupils equal (3 mm), round, briskly reactive; no afferent pupillary defect. Eyes orthotropic with full versions. Cycloplegic refraction: right −0.25 +1.50 ×90°, left +0.50 D. Rest of comprehensive exam unremarkable.
Symptom Onset: Since birth
Symptom Duration: Since birth
Progression: Stable since birth
Characteristics: Congenital right upper lid ptosis since birth; moderate–severe severity; absent/right rudimentary lid crease; levator function reduced (6 mm right vs 12 mm left); chin‑up head posture (~15°); intermittent visual axis occlusion; no anisocoria, normal pupils and motility; minimal anisometropia; no amblyopia.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Looking down (improved in downgaze) — chin‑up posture worsens ptosis impact; activities where lid occludes pupil (e.g., watching TV, walking)
Alleviating Factors: Chin-up head posture (15°) which increases eyelid margin-to-reflex distance from 0.5mm to 2mm on the right, partially exposing the visual axis
Associated Symptoms: chin-up head posture; occasional eyelid blocking pupil; no motility disturbance; no diplopia; no systemic symptoms
Previous Episodes: None
Prior Treatments: None
Impact on Daily Activities: The child holds a 15° chin-up posture and occasionally lets the droopy lid block his pupil, but has good fixation/following and no amblyopia—impact is mild: adaptive head posture needed with occasional visual obstruction but no major functional impairment.
Systemic Symptoms: Negative
Risk Factors: Congenital levator muscle maldevelopment (levator hypoplasia with fibrous/fatty infiltration); family history negative (no hereditary muscular disorders); neonatal factors not specified — thus primary risk: developmental abnormality of levator muscle (congenital).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid with anomalous chin-up head posture and absence of amblyopia.
Primary Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid with anomalous chin-up head posture and absence of amblyopia.
Differential Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis; Horner’s syndrome; Third nerve palsy; Marcus Gunn jaw‑winking ptosis
Severity: Moderate to severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: Early and late infection; suture granuloma; exposure keratopathy; retrobulbar hemorrhage; overcorrections


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow the child throughout childhood with vigilant surveillance for amblyopia and anisometropia until at least age 7–10 years; after any ptosis surgery, follow lid height and healing for ~1 month (monitor for lagophthalmos and provide nighttime lubrication as needed); if Bell’s phenomenon is absent, plan for ongoing lubrication and close monitoring for exposure keratopathy; regular refraction checks and amblyopia management as indicated.
Patient Education: Congenital ptosis is a droopy upper eyelid present since birth due to underdevelopment of the lid muscle. Important points: - Risk: It can block the visual axis and cause amblyopia (lazy eye) or induce astigmatism from eyelid pressure, so regular vision checks are essential. - Head posture: Children often tilt the chin up to see better; this is common and may improve after surgery. - When to seek care: Prompt evaluation and regular follow-up are needed if the lid covers the pupil, vision changes, or a fixation preference develops. - Treatment: Non-surgical care addresses amblyopia and refractive errors (glasses, patching/penalization). Significant ptosis is treated surgically to raise the lid and restore the lid crease; choice of procedure depends on severity and levator function. - Postoperative expectations: Healing takes ~1 month; temporary incomplete eyelid closure (lagophthalmos) and need for nighttime lubrication are common; long-term monitoring for recurrence and amblyopia is required until around age 7–10. - Warning signs: new eyelid droop, asymmetric pupils, eye misalignment, decreased vision, or systemic symptoms (weakness, ptosis variability) warrant urgent re-evaluation.


CASE 84 — The Apparently Blind Infant
=====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Parents concerned their 3-month-old may be blind
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I do not fixate on or follow any target"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 3-month-old girl brought by parents for concerns she may be blind; parents report poor eye contact, no response to parental facial expressions, and lack of response to bright lights. Prenatal and birth histories unremarkable. Past ophthalmologic and medical histories unremarkable. Two siblings developmentally and visually normal and had more visual responsiveness at 3 months. Child appears developmentally normal but has not seen pediatrician in several weeks. On exam: does not fixate or follow targets, does not respond to facial gestures, blinks to bright light; OKN equivocal with occasional nystagmus beats; eyes orthotropic with full oculocephalic versions, no spontaneous nystagmus. Pupils 5 mm, moderately reactive, no afferent pupillary defect or paradoxical reaction. Anterior segment and fundus normal. Parents requested VEP testing.
History Narrative: A 3-month-old girl is brought to her ophthalmologist by her parents because of concerns that she may be blind. They report that she has poor eye contact, that she does not respond to parental facial expressions, and that she does not appear to respond to bright lights. The child’s prenatal and birth histories are unremarkable. Her past ophthalmologic and medical histories are unremarkable. The child has two siblings, aged 2 years and 5 years, who visually responded much more at 3 months of age than the patient does and who are developmentally and visually normal at this time. The review of systems is otherwise negative. The child appears to be normal from a developmental standpoint, though the child has not been seen by her pediatrician in several weeks. On examination, a healthy-appearing 3-month-old girl is sitting on her mother’s lap. The ocular adnexal and other facial features appear normal. The child does not fixate on or follow any target and does not respond to facial gestures. She does blink when a bright light is directed into her eyes. Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) testing demonstrates an occasional beat of nystagmus, but attention is poor and the test results are equivocal. The eyes are orthotropic with full versions to oculocephalic testing. Spontaneous nystagmus is not seen. The pupillary examination reveals pupils that are 5mm in size and moderately reactive to light with no afferent pupillary defect, and no paradoxical pupillary reaction is present. Anterior segment and fundus examinations are normal.
Symptom Onset: 3 months of age
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Improving
Characteristics: Isolated delayed visual maturation in a developmentally and neurologically normal 3‑month‑old girl with poor fixation and following, occasional OKN beats, normal anterior segment and fundus, moderately reactive 5 mm pupils without APD, normal neurologic exam, and expected spontaneous visual improvement by 6–8 months.


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: Explaining carefully to the parents what delayed visual maturation is and its generally favorable prognosis, thereby alleviating parental and referring physician fear
Associated Symptoms: poor eye contact; does not respond to parental facial expressions; does not appear to respond to bright lights; blinks to bright light; occasional beat of OKN; poor attention; no fixation or following; no developmental or neurologic abnormalities on exam
Previous Episodes: None

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Isolated delayed visual maturation (DVM): 3-month-old developmentally and neurologically normal infant with poor fixation and lack of visual attention but normal anterior segment and fundus exams, moderately reactive 5 mm pupils without RAPD, equivocal OKN, no spontaneous nystagmus, and normal screening neurological examination. VEP requested; expect spontaneous improvement of visual behavior by 6–8 months if isolated DVM; further electrophysiologic testing and neuroimaging indicated only if vision fails to improve or if neurologic signs develop.
Primary Diagnosis: Isolated delayed visual maturation
Secondary Diagnoses: Delayed visual maturation (isolated)
Differential Diagnosis: Delayed visual maturation; Cortical visual impairment; Bilateral structural ocular abnormalities (e.g., congenital cataract/optic nerve hypoplasia); Idiopathic infantile nystagmus
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Procedures: exam under anesthesia; funduscopy; refraction; corneal diameter measurement; measurement of intraocular pressure; optokinetic nystagmus testing; oculocephalic testing; pupillary examination; electrophysiologic testing (VEP, ERG, EEG); neuroimaging
Follow-Up Instructions: Periodic developmental and neurologic assessments by the pediatrician; monitor vision—expect improvement by 6–8 months; if vision fails to improve by 6–8 months, obtain electrophysiologic testing and neuroimaging; if associated neurologic/developmental abnormalities, continue prolonged follow-up (may take up to 1–2 years).
Patient Education: Delayed visual maturation (DVM) — many infants who appear visually unresponsive will improve as their visual system matures. In isolated DVM (normal development and neurologic exam) most infants show normal vision by 6–8 months of age. Regular pediatric follow-up and developmental monitoring are recommended. Immediate extensive testing is not usually required unless there are neurologic abnormalities or vision fails to improve by 6–8 months, in which case electrophysiologic testing (VEP/ERG) and neuroimaging may be indicated. Reassurance, close observation, and clear communication with the pediatrician and neurologist are important.
Referrals: Pediatrician and neurologist for developmental and neurological assessment; ophthalmology follow-up; neuroimaging and electrophysiologic testing if vision fails to improve (as secondary referrals if indicated).


CASE 85 — Optic Nerve Hypoplasia
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor vision in the right eye and esotropia (referred for second opinion and treatment)
DURATION: Approximately 1 year
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 3-year-old boy referred after diagnosis of right esotropia and amblyopia at age 2; prescribed full-time patching of the left eye done sporadically for ~6 months with no improvement. Parents note decreased vision in right eye. Medical history notable for weight and height in 15th percentile; otherwise unremarkable. Review of systems negative except ophthalmologic complaints; no family history of strabismus or amblyopia.
History Narrative: A 3-year-old boy referred by another ophthalmologist after a diagnosis of right esotropia and amblyopia at age 2. The referring doctor prescribed full-time patching of the left eye, performed sporadically for ~6 months with no visual improvement. Medical history notable only for weight and height in the 15th percentile; review of systems otherwise negative; no family history of strabismus or amblyopia. Examination showed best-corrected visual acuity 20/200 OD and 20/30 OS, esotropia 25 PD at distance and near with full ductions and versions, a 1+ relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, cycloplegic refraction +1.25 D OU, and initial posterior pole exam suggesting normal disc, macula, and vessels until closer inspection revealed a slightly pale, small right disc with crowded vessels and a double-ring sign; the left disc slightly smaller than normal.
Symptom Onset: 2 years of age
Symptom Duration: Approximately 1 year
Progression: Static/N/A
Characteristics: Bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia with small optic discs (double‑ring sign), crowded nerve vessels, right optic disc pallor, 1+ RAPD OD, associated septo‑optic dysplasia with absence of the septum pellucidum and growth hormone deficiency (short stature, low weight), esotropia OD (25 PD), potential for variable vision (OD 20/200, OS 20/30).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Septo‑optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia causing decreased vision in the right eye (20/200) and mild reduction in the left eye (20/30). Right optic nerve hypoplasia evidenced by small disc with double‑ring sign, crowded vessels, pallor, and a 1+ RAPD. Associated growth hormone deficiency with short stature; absence of the septum pellucidum on MRI consistent with midline CNS malformation. Recommend urgent endocrine evaluation and pituitary hormone testing/replacement as indicated, neuroimaging correlation already consistent with septo‑optic dysplasia, trial of amblyopia therapy for potential functional component, and delayed strabismus surgery until amblyopia therapy optimized. Provide protective eyewear for the better eye and ongoing growth/endocrine surveillance.
Primary Diagnosis: Septo-optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia
Secondary Diagnoses: Optic nerve hypoplasia; Septo‑optic dysplasia; Growth hormone deficiency; Short stature; Esotropia; Amblyopia; Relative afferent pupillary defect (right eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Optic nerve hypoplasia (septo‑optic dysplasia); Amblyopia (functional) secondary to strabismus; Optic atrophy/optic neuritis.
Severity: Septo-optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia — moderate to severe visual impairment (right eye 20/200, left eye 20/30)
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Visual impairment ranging from mild reduced acuity to severe vision loss or no light perception (amblyopia, permanent decreased vision) - Strabismus (esotropia) with risk of recurrence after surgery - Nystagmus (when severe/bilateral ONH) - Endocrine dysfunctions (growth hormone deficiency, corticotrophin/ACTH deficiency leading to adrenal insufficiency) - Midline CNS abnormalities (septo‑optic dysplasia: absence of septum pellucidum, corpus callosum hypoplasia, posterior pituitary ectopia) - Increased risk of sudden death during stress/illness if corticotrophin deficiency untreated - Need for repeated surgeries and long‑term rehabilitation and endocrine follow‑up


Plan
All Medications: steroids (stress-dose corticosteroids as indicated), growth hormone replacement, botulinum toxin (as an option for strabismus), amblyopia patching (occlusion therapy)
All Procedures: full-time patching (occlusion therapy) cycloplegic refraction direct ophthalmoscopy / modified monocular indirect ophthalmoscopy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain endocrine testing / pituitary hormone evaluation pituitary hormone replacement therapy amblyopia therapy strabismus surgery or botulinum toxin injection eye examination under anesthesia (when needed) prescription of polycarbonate protective spectacles
Follow-Up Instructions: Ongoing evaluation of growth and endocrine parameters throughout early childhood with endocrinology follow-up; continue amblyopia therapy and reassess before strabismus surgery; prescribe polycarbonate protective spectacles for the better-seeing eye; administer stress‑dose corticosteroids when indicated for patients with corticotrophin abnormalities.
Patient Education: Explain optic nerve hypoplasia (small optic nerves) and that it can cause a wide range of vision loss; the right eye has reduced vision and may have both anatomic underdevelopment and amblyopia, so a trial of patching/amblyopia therapy may help. Because optic nerve hypoplasia can be linked with midline brain and pituitary problems (septo‑optic dysplasia), neuroimaging (MRI) and endocrine evaluation are important—growth hormone and adrenal (corticotrophin) deficiencies can occur and need prompt treatment. Continue regular growth and endocrine follow‑up; give stress‑dose steroids if corticotrophin deficiency is present during illness, surgery, or injury. Discuss timing of strabismus surgery (usually after amblyopia therapy and often delayed until school age) and higher chance of recurrence. Recommend protective polycarbonate glasses for the better eye. Encourage regular ophthalmology and endocrinology/pediatric follow‑up and promptly report any new symptoms (poor growth, fatigue, hypoglycemia, severe illness).
Referrals: Endocrinology (endocrinologist) and pediatrician for pituitary/hormone evaluation and ongoing growth/endocrine follow-up; ophthalmology referral for second opinion/amblyopia and strabismus management; neuroimaging (MRI) referral.
Emergency Instructions: Stress doses of corticosteroids should be administered in patients with corticotrophin abnormalities in situations such as acute illness, surgery, or serious injury.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Ptosis of both upper eyelids due to levator aponeurosis disinsertion (aponeurotic ptosis), worse on the right, with preserved levator function and deep superior sulci consistent with age-related aponeurotic dehiscence.
Primary Diagnosis: Ptosis of both upper eyelids due to levator aponeurosis disinsertion
Differential Diagnosis: Aponeurotic (age-related levator aponeurosis dehiscence); Neurogenic ptosis (e.g., Horner’s syndrome or CN III palsy, myasthenia gravis); Myogenic ptosis (congenital levator deficiency or systemic myopathy); Mechanical ptosis (eyelid mass or severe blepharochalasis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: undercorrection; overcorrection; asymmetric or unsatisfactory lid contour; lagophthalmos with exposure symptoms


Plan
All Procedures: bilateral cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement; external levator advancement on both upper eyelids
Patient Education: Aponeurotic (age‑related) ptosis occurs when the levator aponeurosis loosens from the eyelid, causing drooping. Because your levator muscle strength is good, surgery to reattach/advance the levator is the usual long‑term treatment when vision is affected. Non‑surgical temporizing options include taping the lid or eyelid crutches on glasses, but these are often temporary. The common surgical approach is an external levator advancement (through a small skin crease incision) to restore the eyelid crease and height; an alternative is a posterior approach (Müller’s muscle resection) in selected cases. Surgery is often done with local anesthesia so eyelid position can be adjusted during the procedure. Expected benefits: improved superior visual field and eyelid symmetry. Possible complications: undercorrection or overcorrection, asymmetry or contour irregularity, and incomplete eyelid closure (lagophthalmos) with exposure symptoms. If there is any sudden change, fluctuating weakness, double vision, or pupil changes, notify the clinic promptly for further neurologic workup (e.g., testing for myasthenia gravis or Horner’s syndrome).

The patient has discovered that she can alleviate her pain if she manually retracts her right lower eyelid. Examination shows “in-turning” of the right lower eyelid causing the lashes to rub against the epibulbar surface. Moderate horizontal laxity of the lower lid is present. With gentle downward traction on the right lower eyelid, the lid margin can be restored to its normal position; however, the in-turning recurs when the patient blinks.
Symptom Onset: 2 years
Symptom Duration: 2 years
Progression: Progressively worsening for 2 years
Characteristics: In-turning of the right lower eyelid with lashes rubbing on the globe; moderate horizontal lower lid laxity; eyelid can be manually everted (digital eversion positive); involutional (age-related) etiology.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Blinking; eyelash rubbing against the globe (lash–epibulbar surface contact)
Alleviating Factors: manually retracts her right lower eyelid
Associated Symptoms: Severe right eye pain relieved by manually retracting the right lower eyelid; ocular irritation from lashes rubbing on epibulbar surface (foreign-body sensation)
Previous Episodes: The patient reported that her severe right eye pain had been progressively worsening for 2 years; no prior episodes are mentioned—so infer: none/first episode (2-year progressive onset).
Prior Treatments: Taping the lid; lubricating drops and ointment; temporizing everting sutures (Quickert‑Rathbun sutures)
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant impairment — severe right eye pain for 2 years causing manual eyelid retraction to relieve discomfort, ocular irritation from lash rubbing, and need for surgical correction (Wies procedure).
Risk Factors: Advanced age, horizontal eyelid laxity, disinsertion/dehiscence of lower eyelid retractors, overriding of preseptal orbicularis, relative enophthalmos (orbital soft‑tissue atrophy)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 89-year-old woman with involutional entropion of the right lower eyelid presenting with 2 years of progressive right eye pain relieved by manual eversion. Examination: inward rotation of right lower lid lashes abrading the epibulbar surface, moderate horizontal lid laxity, lid margin can be manually everted but re-inverts with blinking; lid not restricted, consistent with involutional (age-related) entropion due to horizontal laxity, retractor disinsertion and orbicularis override. Plan: temporizing measures (lubrication, taping, possible Quickert-Rathbun sutures) with definitive surgical correction via lower eyelid tightening/repair (Wies procedure performed with satisfactory correction and no postoperative complications).
Primary Diagnosis: Involutional entropion of the right lower eyelid
Differential Diagnosis: Involutional entropion; Spastic entropion (due to ocular irritation/lid edema); Cicatricial entropion (eg, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, mucous membrane pemphigoid, posttraumatic scarring)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: None


Plan
All Medications: lubricating drops and ointment
All Procedures: Wies procedure of the right lower eyelid
Patient Education: - Entropion is when the lower eyelid turns inward so the lashes rub the eye, causing pain and irritation. - Cause: in older adults it’s usually involutional — eyelid laxity, weakened lower lid retractors, and muscle overriding. - Short-term measures: lubricating drops/ointment and taping or temporary everting (Quickert-Rathbun) sutures can relieve symptoms. - Definitive treatment: surgical options include Wies procedure (performed for you with good result), lateral tarsal strip (horizontal tightening), or reattachment of the lower lid retractors; choice depends on the underlying problem. - After surgery: expect improved comfort and lid position; follow wound-care instructions, use prescribed drops/ointments, avoid rubbing the eye, and attend scheduled postoperative visits. - Seek care promptly for increasing pain, sudden vision changes, heavy discharge, wound opening, or signs of infection (redness, swelling, fever).


CASE 90 — Trichiasis

Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chronic irritation of the left eye for 2 years
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: Left
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 64-year-old woman with 2-year history of chronic left eye irritation, gradually worsening, with no prior ocular history. Exam showed left lower lid entropion easily repositioned, row of fine nonpigmented posterior lashes contacting the globe, mild inferior punctate corneal changes, inferior bulbar rose bengal staining, diffuse lid margin thickening with telangiectasia, and scattered lash debris/collarettes on all lids.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman presented with complaints of chronic irritation of the left eye that had been worsening over the last 2 years. There was no previous ocular history. Ophthalmic examination was remarkable for an entropion of the left lower eyelid. The lid was easily returned to its normal position using gentle manual downward pressure. The tarsal conjunctiva showed mild erythema without evidence of cicatricial changes, and the inferior fornix was deep without symblepharon. When the lid was everted, a row of fine nonpigmented lashes was noted posterior to the gray line. These lashes were in contact with the epibulbar surface. Mild punctate corneal changes were present inferiorly. The inferior bulbar conjunctiva showed rose bengal staining in the areas associated with the abnormal lashes. Diffuse thickening of the lid margin was noted as well as the presence of fine telangiectatic vessels. Scattered debris, including collarettes, were present on the lashes of all four eyelids.
Symptom Onset: 2 years

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Trichiasis of the left lower eyelid due to aberrant lashes (distichiasis) in the setting of left lower lid entropion. Associated blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction of all four eyelids with mild inferior punctate corneal epithelial change and focal inferior bulbar conjunctival staining from lash contact. Lid margin thickening with telangiectasia and scattered collarettes. Overall symptoms attributable to eyelid malposition plus distichiasis causing mechanical irritation; tear-film insufficiency/ocular surface disease likely contributory.
Primary Diagnosis: Trichiasis of the lower eyelid due to aberrant lashes (distichiasis) and lower lid entropion
Secondary Diagnoses: Blepharitis; Meibomian gland dysfunction; Distichiasis; Lower eyelid entropion
Differential Diagnosis: Entropion with trichiasis; Distichiasis (metaplastic meibomian gland lashes); Blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: Loss of skin pigmentation and eyelid notching


Plan
All Medications: lubricating drops and ointment
All Procedures: Wies procedure (lower eyelid entropion repair); cryotherapy to aberrant lashes (initial and subsequent retreatment)
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative follow-up with repeat cryotherapy for any focal recurrent distichiasis; maintain lid hygiene program for blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction; use lubricating drops/ointment as needed.
Patient Education: - Explanation: Your lower eyelid is turning inward (entropion) and there are extra, fine lashes growing from oil gland openings (distichiasis). These lashes rub the eye and cause irritation and corneal damage (trichiasis). - Immediate measures: Keep eyelids clean with daily lid hygiene (warm compresses and gentle lid scrubs) and use preservative-free artificial tears frequently; apply ointment at night for added protection. - Temporary relief: Individual offending lashes can be plucked (epilation) but often recur within months. - Definitive treatments: Options include cryotherapy or laser/electrolysis to destroy aberrant follicles, or surgery (wedge excision, lash follicle excision, lid-splitting, and repair of the entropion). Your surgeon recommended entropion repair (Wies procedure) plus cryotherapy in this case. - What to expect after treatment: Improvement of rubbing and irritation, but lashes can recur and may need repeat treatment. Possible side effects include temporary swelling, pigment changes, or small notches in the eyelid. - When to seek care: Return promptly for increased pain, redness, worsening vision, pus, or if symptoms recur. Routine follow-up will monitor for recurrence and manage blepharitis/meibomian dysfunction.


CASE 91 — Dacryocystitis
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Tearing and pain of the right lower eyelid medially
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "constant epiphora of the right eye since the time of her surgeries" "intermittent redness of the right lower eyelid, associated with tenderness and mucous discharge from the eye"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 44-year-old woman with a long history of constant right-sided epiphora since multiple prior midface surgeries for lethal midline granuloma (including nasal septum removal and frontoethmoidectomies), who more recently developed intermittent redness, tenderness, mucous discharge from the right lower eyelid medially, and pain; previously treated with an unknown topical antibiotic; on exam erythema and tenderness over the right medial lower lid with mucoid discharge expressed from the punctum; nasolacrimal irrigation showed distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction with patent proximal system.
History Narrative: A 44-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of tearing and pain of the right lower eyelid medially. Her past medical history was significant for lethal midline granuloma (midfacial necrotizing lesion) for which she had undergone multiple procedures, including removal of the nasal septum and frontoethmoidectomies. She reported constant epiphora of the right eye since the time of her surgeries and had more recently noted intermittent redness of the right lower eyelid, associated with tenderness and mucous discharge from the eye. She had been previously treated with an unknown ophthalmic antibiotic drop. Examination showed erythema of the right lower lid medially with associated tenderness to palpation. No definite masses were palpated in the lacrimal sac region. There was a whitish mucoid discharge expressed from the punctum upon palpation of the lacrimal sac, and the conjunctiva was mildly injected. The puncta of the right upper and lower eyelid were present and appeared patent. There was a well-healed surgical incision over the nose with residual distortion of the nasal architecture. The remainder of the ophthalmic examination was completely normal. Nasolacrimal irrigation was performed and demonstrated complete obstruction of the distal nasal lacrimal system. The upper system was patent as demonstrated by the reflux of irrigating solution through the upper and lower puncta. Inspection of the inner nose showed a large nasal defect with an absent septum.
Symptom Onset: Since the time of her surgeries
Symptom Duration: Constant epiphora of the right eye since the time of her surgeries (chronic, long-standing)
Progression: Resolved after treatment with oral antibiotics followed by dacryocystorhinostomy with silicone tubing; epiphora improved and inflammation resolved.
Characteristics: Infection of lacrimal sac due to nasolacrimal duct obstruction causing tearing, pain, redness, swelling in medial canthal area, mucous discharge, tenderness, and possible abscess formation.

Differential Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis; Thyroid-related orbitopathy (thyroid eye disease); Orbital lymphoma/neoplastic infiltration; Systemic vasculitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: scleritis and secondary choroidal effusion


Plan
All Medications: methylprednisolone (IV 250 mg every 6 hours), oral prednisone
All Procedures: MRI of the orbits with and without gadolinium; Intravenous methylprednisolone then conversion to oral prednisone; Dilated fundus examination
Follow-Up Instructions: Referred for systemic evaluation for collagen‑vascular disease and lymphoma; slow taper of oral prednisone with clinical follow‑up and repeat MRI to ensure resolution and exclude underlying neoplasm.
Patient Education: Idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital pseudotumor) is an inflammatory condition causing eye pain, swelling, redness, and sometimes vision change. It is not caused by cancer in this case and often responds rapidly to high‑dose corticosteroids. Key points for you: - Cause and prognosis: The exact cause is unknown (idiopathic). With prompt steroid treatment most patients improve quickly and recover normal vision, as happened here. - Treatment plan: You received intravenous steroids followed by an oral prednisone taper. It is important to finish the taper as directed to prevent recurrence and withdrawal symptoms. - Symptoms to watch for: Return of eye pain, increasing redness, new or worsening vision loss, fever, or signs of infection—report these immediately. - Medication precautions: Take prednisone exactly as prescribed. Do not stop suddenly. Expect possible side effects (increased appetite, fluid retention, mood changes, elevated blood pressure, blood sugar changes). Because you have hypertension, monitor your blood pressure closely and inform your primary doctor; adjustments to blood‑pressure medications may be needed. - Follow‑up and testing: Keep scheduled ophthalmology follow‑ups and the recommended systemic workup (blood tests/imaging) to exclude systemic disease (e.g., autoimmune disorders or lymphoma). A repeat MRI was done and was normal; further imaging or biopsy would be considered only if symptoms recur or do not respond to treatment. - Eye care measures: Use cool compresses for comfort and avoid rubbing the eye. If prescribed topical drops, use as directed. - When to seek urgent care: sudden worsening vision, severe increasing pain, fever, or signs of steroid complications (severe weakness, chest pain, severe mood changes). If you have questions about your prednisone dose, side effects, or blood‑pressure management while on steroids, contact your treating physician.
Referrals: Systemic evaluation for collagen-vascular disease or lymphoma

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Orbital cellulitis of the right orbit with superomedial subperiosteal abscess secondary to ethmoid sinusitis; failed initial oral antibiotic therapy with progression to complete upper eyelid ptosis, decreased extraocular motility, mild proptosis, conjunctival injection and fever. Imaging (CT) confirmed large right superomedial subperiosteal abscess and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening. Treated with urgent surgical drainage of subperiosteal abscess and ethmoidectomy plus IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clindamycin) with marked clinical improvement and eventual complete resolution of swelling and motility deficit.
Primary Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis
Secondary Diagnoses: ethmoid sinusitis; subperiosteal orbital abscess; fever; enlarged preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy
Differential Diagnosis: Preseptal cellulitis; Idiopathic orbital inflammation; Orbital infiltration by malignancy (leukemia/retinoblastoma)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: orbital apex syndrome; blindness; brain abscess; cavernous sinus thrombosis; death


Plan
All Medications: oral antibiotics intravenous ceftriaxone clindamycin oxacillin (mentioned as example for preseptal cellulitis) penicillinase-resistant penicillin (general class)
All Procedures: Drainage of large right superomedial subperiosteal orbital abscess; right ethmoidectomy; intraoperative purulent culture collection; preoperative blood cultures.
Follow-Up Instructions: Subsequent follow-up examination to confirm resolution of periorbital swelling and motility restriction.
Patient Education: Orbital cellulitis is a serious infection behind the eyelid that can cause pain, swelling, fever, limited eye movement, and occasionally vision loss. It most often follows sinus infection or eyelid trauma. Because it can progress rapidly and cause complications (abscess, vision loss, brain infection), prompt medical care is essential. Key points and instructions: - This condition requires urgent evaluation and treatment in the hospital, often with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage of an abscess. - Follow all hospital and ENT/surgery recommendations; if surgery is recommended (e.g., drainage or sinus surgery), it is important to proceed to prevent vision- or life-threatening complications. - Take all prescribed antibiotics exactly as directed. Do not stop antibiotics early even if symptoms improve. - Report immediately to the emergency department or your surgeon if you notice: worsening vision, new double vision, increasing pain, increased swelling or redness, high fever, severe headache, confusion, or seizures. - Keep follow-up appointments with ophthalmology and ENT to monitor healing and eye function. Visual acuity and eye movement will be rechecked. - Pain can be managed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as advised by the team; avoid NSAIDs only if specifically instructed otherwise. - At-home care after discharge: rest, keep the head elevated to reduce swelling, apply cool compresses if recommended, and finish the full course of oral antibiotics. - If cultures identified a specific organism, take any additional precautions or medication adjustments given by the infectious disease team. If you have questions about medications, wound care, activity restrictions, or signs of recurrence, contact the treating team or return to the emergency department immediately.
Referrals: ENT surgeon; pediatric infectious disease consult

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 12-year-old boy with 1-week history of left upper eyelid swelling and tenderness. Exam: redness and fullness of the temporal left upper lid with “S-shaped” deformity, marked injection and chemosis of the lateral bulbar conjunctiva, enlargement and erythema of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, moderate tenderness, and mild regional lymphadenopathy. No motility deficit or intraocular inflammation. Serology: positive anti-EBV viral capsid antigen antibodies and negative anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibodies. Impression: acute dacryoadenitis of the left eye, most consistent with recent EBV infection. Management: conservative/medical therapy (consider topical or oral corticosteroids if inflammatory; antibiotics only if bacterial infection suspected), with follow-up for resolution.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute dacryoadenitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Epstein–Barr virus infection
Differential Diagnosis: Acute infectious dacryoadenitis (viral—EBV/mumps; bacterial—Staphylococcus/Streptococcus/Gonococcus); Idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease (orbital pseudotumor) involving lacrimal gland; Lacrimal gland neoplasm (primary epithelial/nonepithelial tumor or metastatic involvement)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: topical corticosteroid; oral corticosteroid; empiric topical antibiotic; empiric systemic antibiotic
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for resolution of symptoms.
Patient Education: Acute dacryoadenitis is inflammation of the lacrimal (tear) gland, usually causing pain, swelling, redness and a fullness of the outer upper eyelid often with tearing. In many children it is caused by a recent viral infection (commonly EBV) and often improves on its own over days to weeks. What to expect - Eyelid swelling and tenderness that should gradually lessen over days to weeks. - No surgery is usually needed. When caused by a virus, antibiotics are not helpful unless a bacterial infection is suspected. Home care - Apply warm compresses to the affected eyelid for 10–15 minutes 3–4 times daily to reduce discomfort. - Avoid pressing or massaging the area. - Use over‑the‑counter pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) as needed and as directed for age/weight. When treatment is used - If bacterial infection is suspected, your child may receive topical and/or oral antibiotics. - If inflammation is pronounced and not improving, a short course of oral corticosteroids may be considered by the doctor. Follow‑up and warning signs - Return for follow‑up as scheduled to ensure resolution. - Seek immediate care if your child develops worsening pain, fever, decreased vision, double vision, increasing eyelid redness/swelling, inability to move the eye, or any new neurological symptoms.


CASE 95 — Orbital Tumors of Childhood
=====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mass over the right eye, present since shortly after birth with slow enlargement
DURATION: 8 months
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: An 8-month-old healthy boy whose parents noted a mass over the right eye present since shortly after birth with slow continual enlargement; no change in color or size with crying or Valsalva; otherwise healthy, full‑term birth after uncomplicated pregnancy. Examination showed a moderately firm, fixed superotemporal right eyelid mass (≈20×10×5 mm) with intact overlying skin, no measurable proptosis, central fixation and following in each eye.
History Narrative: An 8-month-old healthy boy presented for evaluation of a mass over the right eye. The mass had been present since shortly after birth, and the parents reported a slow continual enlargement of the mass. The child was born at full-term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. He was otherwise healthy with no known medical problems. There was no associated change in color or size of the mass with crying or Valsalva’s maneuvers. Examination showed central fixation with following in each eye. The rest of his ophthalmic exam was only notable for a moderately firm mass over the superotemporal right eyelid. The mass measured approximately 20 mm × 10 mm × 5 mm and was fixed to the underlying tissues. The overlying skin was intact without discoloration or ulceration. Careful palpation of the superior orbital rim revealed no discernable defect. There was no measurable proptosis, and both orbits were normal to retropulsion. No other masses were palpated.
Symptom Onset: Shortly after birth
Symptom Duration: Approximately 8 months (present since shortly after birth)
Progression: Slow continual enlargement since shortly after birth
Characteristics: Moderately firm, well-circumscribed, fixed to underlying tissues, 20 mm × 10 mm × 5 mm, overlying skin intact without discoloration or ulceration, located superotemporal at the orbital rim.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 8-month-old boy with a congenital, slowly enlarging, firm, well‑circumscribed superotemporal right orbital mass measuring approximately 20 × 10 × 5 mm, fixed to underlying tissues with intact overlying skin, no proptosis or bone defect on palpation, central fixation and following in both eyes. Clinical presentation and location at the zygomaticofrontal suture consistent with a dermoid cyst of the right orbit. Recommended and performed surgical excision via lid-crease approach; complete removal achieved without complication.
Primary Diagnosis: Dermoid cyst of the right orbit
Differential Diagnosis: Dermoid cyst; Epidermoid cyst; Capillary hemangioma; Rhabdomyosarcoma
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: None reported


Plan
All Procedures: Excision of right orbital dermoid cyst via lid crease incision
Follow-Up Instructions: Routine postoperative follow-up with ophthalmology to monitor wound healing and eyelid function; return for suture removal and wound check in ~1 week; routine long-term follow-up as needed for cosmetic outcome and to monitor for recurrence.
Patient Education: This mass is a dermoid cyst — a benign, congenital (present from birth) cystic lesion commonly found at the superotemporal orbital rim. It grows slowly and can rupture if injured, which may cause significant inflammation. Because of this risk, surgical removal is recommended; the operation is typically done through a lid-crease incision for a concealed scar. There is no effective medical (non‑surgical) treatment. Surgery is usually postponed until the infant is at least 6 months old when possible to lower anesthesia risk. After complete excision recurrence is unlikely and prognosis is excellent. Follow-up exams will check healing and eye function; seek prompt care if you notice redness, swelling, discharge, sudden increase in size, or changes in the child’s vision or eye movements.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 44-year-old man with painless progressive left proptosis, 4 mm relative proptosis OS, increased resistance to retropulsion, change in refractive error, CT showing a well-circumscribed retrobulbar enhancing mass without bony changes, consistent with a left orbital cavernous hemangioma; underwent lateral orbitotomy with en bloc excision and histopathologic confirmation of cavernous hemangioma.
Primary Diagnosis: Probable cavernous hemangioma of the left orbit
Differential Diagnosis: Cavernous hemangioma; Hemangiopericytoma; Orbital lymphoma (lymphoproliferative lesion); Lacrimal gland epithelial tumor (pleomorphic adenoma)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: None


Plan
All Procedures: Lateral orbitotomy; surgical excision (removal in toto) of left orbital cavernous hemangioma
Follow-Up Instructions: Patient did well postoperatively; monitor visual acuity, refraction, and resolution of choroidal striae with routine postoperative visits; observe for recurrence with periodic orbital exam and imaging as indicated.
Patient Education: This is most likely a benign cavernous hemangioma of the orbit — a slow-growing, encapsulated vascular tumor that commonly causes painless proptosis. Imaging (CT or MRI) helps define its size and location. Because yours caused progressive bulging and a change in vision, surgical removal via a lateral orbitotomy was recommended and performed; the tumor was removed intact and pathology confirmed the diagnosis. What to expect after surgery - Recovery: Mild pain, swelling, bruising, and temporary bruising around the eye are common and improve over days to weeks. Keep head elevated and use cold packs in the first 48 hours as instructed. - Vision: Vision typically returns to baseline; your left-eye prescription stabilized after surgery (to approximately −2.00 D). Report any sudden vision decrease, new double vision, severe pain, or fever immediately. - Eye movements: Temporary limitation or discomfort with eye movement may occur but usually improves. Persistent diplopia is uncommon with uncomplicated removal. - Wound care: Keep the incision clean and dry; follow wound-care instructions and avoid strenuous activity or heavy lifting until cleared. - Medications: Take prescribed pain medication and any antibiotic or steroid drops/systemic medications as directed. Finish the full course if given. - Follow-up: Attend scheduled postoperative visits to monitor healing, vision, and intraorbital status. Imaging is generally not required after complete removal unless symptoms recur. - Recurrence: Cavernous hemangiomas are usually cured by complete excision and rarely recur; report any new progressive proptosis or visual change. - When to seek care: sudden vision loss, increasing eye pain, severe swelling, signs of infection (fever, increased redness, drainage), or new/progressive bulging. Lifestyle and long-term outlook - No specific activity restrictions long-term; gradual return to normal activities as advised. - Prognosis is excellent after complete removal; most patients have resolution of proptosis and stabilization of refractive change.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Benign eyelid tumor of the left upper eyelid, most consistent with an intradermal nevus: a slow‑growing 10×8×5 mm smooth, dome‑shaped, amelanotic preseptal skin lesion without ulceration, telangiectasia, madarosis, or regional lymphadenopathy. Excisional biopsy performed; histopathology confirmed intradermal nevus. No evidence of recurrence on follow‑up.
Primary Diagnosis: Benign eyelid tumor, most likely intradermal nevus
Differential Diagnosis: Intradermal nevus; Squamous papilloma; Seborrheic keratosis; Hidrocystoma
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left
Complications: None


Plan
All Procedures: Excisional biopsy of left upper eyelid lesion (office procedure under local anesthesia) with primary repair/allowed to heal by secondary intention as appropriate; specimen sent for histopathologic examination
Follow-Up Instructions: Patient has done well without evidence of recurrence; routine postoperative follow-up with wound check and ophthalmic exam as needed.
Patient Education: This lesion is a benign intradermal nevus—slow‑growing and not cancerous. No medical therapy is needed. Options include simple observation or surgical removal; removal is often done in the office under local anesthesia and the small wound can be closed directly or left to heal on its own. Because excision is performed for diagnosis and cosmesis, the tissue is sent to pathology to confirm the diagnosis. After excision expect mild pain, swelling, bruising, and a small scar; keep the wound clean, follow wound care instructions, and avoid rubbing or strenuous activity that stresses the eyelid. Report increasing pain, spreading redness, drainage, fever, or any rapid regrowth of the lesion. Routine follow‑up is advised to review pathology and monitor for recurrence.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with an 8-month history of an enlarging, fairly rapidly growing nonpigmented nodule of the right upper eyelid near the medial canthus, with one episode of bleeding after picking, extensive sun exposure history, and no prior skin cancer.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man presented for evaluation of an enlarging skin nodule of his right upper eyelid. The lesion had been present for approximately 8 months and had grown fairly rapidly. The patient recalled one episode of bleeding from the area after he had picked at the lesion. While there was no previous history of skin cancer, the patient reported an extensive sun-exposure history. His ophthalmic examination was within normal limits except for the external examination. There was a large elevated nonpigmented nodule involving the skin of the right upper eyelid near the medial canthal region. The nodule measured 15 mm × 12 mm × 7 mm and showed numerous small telangiectatic vessels on its surface. The edges of the tumor had a thickened pearly appearance. There was no ulceration present. The skin underlying the lesion was freely moveable, and the tumor did not appear fixed to the underlying deep structures. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. The skin of the patient’s face showed diffuse sun-exposure changes consisting of fine wrinkles and telangiectatic vessels and scattered areas of crusting.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Lesion of the right upper eyelid (medial canthal region); probable basal cell carcinoma. Evidence: 8-month history of a rapidly enlarging, nonpigmented elevated 15 × 12 × 7 mm nodule with telangiectasias, pearly thickened edges, one episode of bleeding, freely mobile over deep structures, no regional lymphadenopathy. Clinical impression most consistent with nodular basal cell carcinoma; tissue diagnosis required (biopsy recommended).
Primary Diagnosis: Lesion of the right upper eyelid (medial canthal region); probable basal cell carcinoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Extensive sun-exposure history; diffuse facial actinic changes (solar elastosis/telangiectasias)
Differential Diagnosis: Basal cell carcinoma; Squamous cell carcinoma; Sebaceous gland carcinoma; Malignant melanoma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: right
Complications: None reported


Plan
All Medications: Imiquimod; 5-fluorouracil; Vismodegib; Sonidegib
All Procedures: Excisional biopsy of right upper eyelid lesion with intraoperative frozen section analysis confirming basal cell carcinoma and full-thickness skin graft repair of the resultant defect.
Follow-Up Instructions: Educated about increased risk for new skin malignancies and placed under dermatologist care for continued surveillance.
Patient Education: Educated about his increased risk for the development of new skin malignancies and placed under the care of a dermatologist for continued surveillance.
Referrals: Dermatology and oncology (for complete metastatic evaluation if sebaceous carcinoma or melanoma suspected)
