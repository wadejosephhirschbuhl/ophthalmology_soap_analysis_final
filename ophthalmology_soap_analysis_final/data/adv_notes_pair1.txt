CHIEF COMPLAINT: bilateral itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and crusting eyelids in the morning
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have bilateral itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and crusting eyelids in the morning."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 42-year-old woman with no past ocular history presents with bilateral itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and morning eyelid crusting. Symptoms have occurred intermittently for 2 years but recently worsened. She denies ocular medications and systemic illness including allergies, rosacea, or flulike symptoms.
History Narrative: A 42-year-old woman with no past ocular history presents with complaints of bilateral itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and crusting eyelids in the morning. Although she has experienced these symptoms intermittently over the last 2 years, her symptoms have recently become worse. She denies taking any ocular medications. Her symptoms are unrelated to any systemic illness including allergy, rosacea, or flulike symptoms.
Symptom Onset: Over the last 2 years, with recent worsening.
Symptom Duration: 2 years
Progression: Worsening over recent period (symptoms recently became worse)
Characteristics: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, likely adenoviral; bilateral itching, burning, foreign body sensation, morning eyelid crusting; mild eyelid margin erythema with scaling/crusting, trichiasis, madarosis, poliosis; mild conjunctival hyperemia with inferior papillary reaction; diminished tear lake, inferior superficial punctate epithelial erosions, mild aqueous tear deficiency.


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: Cool compresses and unpreserved lubricants; strict hygiene (hand washing, isolating soiled tissues/washcloths/pillowcases)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, most consistent with adenoviral conjunctivitis — bilateral ocular itching, burning, foreign body sensation, morning crusting, mild eyelid margin erythema with scaling and crusting, trichiasis/madarosis/poliosis, mild conjunctival hyperemia with inferior tarsal papillary reaction, diminished tear lake, inferior superficial punctate epithelial erosions on rose bengal, and mild aqueous tear deficiency on Schirmer testing. Managed with observation, cool compresses and unpreserved lubricants; patient counseled on contagiousness, hygiene, and return in 4–6 weeks or sooner for membranes, worsening corneal involvement, or persistent symptoms.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, likely adenoviral
Secondary Diagnoses: Blepharitis; Aqueous tear deficiency (mild); Meibomian gland dysfunction (inferred)
Differential Diagnosis: Adenoviral (viral) conjunctivitis; Bacterial conjunctivitis; Chlamydial (inclusion) conjunctivitis; Allergic/blepharitis-related conjunctival inflammation
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: loteprednol povidone iodine dexamethasone trifluridine vidarabine ganciclovir cidofovir 2′3′-dideoxycytidine interferon β interferon γ immunoglobulin N-chlorotaurine acyclovir valacyclovir tetracycline doxycycline erythromycin sulfisoxazole azithromycin mitomycin C
All Procedures: removal of conjunctival membranes or pseudomembranes with forceps or cotton swab placement of a self-retained amniotic membrane exam (slit-lamp examination) rose bengal dye examination Schirmer test fluorescein, lissamine green, or rose bengal corneal staining noninvasive tear osmolarity and MMP-9 point-of-care testing meibomian gland imaging (e.g., LipiView) excision/removal of conjunctival membranes to prevent symblepharon excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy with low-dose mitomycin C
Follow-Up Instructions: Examine in 4–6 weeks to confirm symptom improvement, follicle regression, and fading corneal opacities; earlier/more frequent visits if visually threatening corneal opacities or conjunctival membranes/pseudomembranes develop; ensure proper medication adherence.
Patient Education: The condition is likely viral and contagious; practice strict personal hygiene (frequent hand washing), avoid sharing tissues/washcloths/pillowcases, use cool compresses and preservative‑free lubricating drops for comfort, expect symptoms to persist 1–2 weeks (or longer), return sooner if membranes, worsening vision, or increased pain occur, and follow up in 4–6 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen.
Work Restrictions: Avoid close contact with others and maintain strict hygiene; no specific work restrictions documented.


CASE 02 — Chronic Follicular Conjunctivitis
===========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: photophobia, discomfort, and headache centered around her right eye for 2 weeks
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I specifically deny any sexual contact."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 37-year-old female with 2 weeks of right-eye photophobia, discomfort, and headache; 1 week prior sudden onset right-eye redness and watering after returning from vacation in Hawaii; noted swelling in front of right ear; initially seen and treated with 2-week topical tobramycin–dexamethasone with temporary node decrease, but 2 days after stopping drops developed corneal epithelial infiltrates and persistent follicles; vision 20/25 OD, 20/20 OS; right-sided nontender preauricular node, mild right upper‑lid ptosis, conjunctival injection and moderate pretarsal follicles OD, left eye quiet.
History Narrative: A 37-year-old female office worker presented with a 2-week history of photophobia, discomfort, and headache centered around her right eye. One week into the course she developed sudden onset redness and watering of the right eye on the first day back at work after a vacation in Hawaii; she also noted swelling in front of her right ear. She had been seen by an eye‑care practitioner who found unilateral follicular conjunctivitis with a mildly tender preauricular node and was treated with a 2‑week course of topical tobramycin–dexamethasone drops. The node became slightly smaller but, two days after stopping the drops, she developed corneal epithelial infiltrates and persistent follicles. She denied sexual contact and systemic/genital symptoms; she had used hotel facilities and swimming pools during her vacation. Visual acuity was 20/25 right and 20/20 left. Examination showed a right nontender preauricular node, 1–2 mm right upper‑lid ptosis, mild bulbar conjunctival injection, moderate medium‑sized pretarsal follicles and papillae on the right (fewer follicles inferiorly in the left), and diffuse midperipheral and a few central corneal epithelial infiltrates in the right eye with no stromal involvement; left cornea and anterior segment were normal. Prior topical corticosteroid use likely altered the clinical presentation. Tests (adenovirus, HSV, chlamydia) were negative. Medication history notable for topical tobramycin–dexamethasone and later brimonidine, which was ultimately discontinued as the suspected offending agent.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks before presentation
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Progression: Improved — follicles resolved by 2 months after stopping brimonidine.
Characteristics: Unilateral chronic follicular conjunctivitis with pretarsal follicles and papillae, mild bulbar injection, right-sided (1–2 mm) ptosis, right corneal epithelial infiltrates (diffuse midperipheral and a few central), and a (initially) nontender preauricular lymph node; onset after topical tobramycin–dexamethasone and associated with brimonidine exposure (toxic etiology).


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Use of topical tobramycin–dexamethasone (and prior topical corticosteroids), and brimonidine (topical glaucoma medication)
Alleviating Factors: Discontinuation of brimonidine; preservative-free lubrication (artificial tears/ointment) and cold compresses
Associated Symptoms: photophobia, discomfort, headache, redness, watering (epiphora), eyelid swelling (ptosis), preauricular lymph node enlargement
Previous Episodes: No prior episodes noted
Prior Treatments: Topical tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension drops (2-week course); brimonidine (discontinued)
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — photophobia, discomfort, and headache affecting work activities; improved after stopping offending agent.
Systemic Symptoms: None
Recent Travel: Hawaii
Risk Factors: Recent use of topical ophthalmic medications (tobramycin–dexamethasone, brimonidine), prior topical corticosteroid use, exposure to fomites/swimming pools during travel, recent viral prodrome/possible adenoviral exposure.

Fundus Exam – Optic Nerve: Disc appears normal (no optic nerve swelling or cupping noted)


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Unilateral toxic chronic follicular conjunctivitis likely secondary to topical brimonidine use, with prior topical tobramycin–dexamethasone possibly masking corneal findings; infectious causes (adenovirus, HSV, chlamydia) were ruled out by negative testing.
Primary Diagnosis: Unilateral toxic chronic follicular conjunctivitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Nontender right preauricular lymphadenopathy; epithelial corneal infiltrates (right eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis; Chlamydial (adult inclusion) conjunctivitis; Herpes simplex/EB virus keratoconjunctivitis; Toxic (medicamentosa) follicular conjunctivitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: punctal stenosis; subconjunctival scarring; conjunctival scarring with fornix obliteration/symblepharon; loss of conjunctival goblet cells; severe ocular surface disease (superficial punctate keratopathy, epithelial erosions, corneal ulceration/melting)


Plan
All Medications: tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension; topical tobramycin; dexamethasone; topical corticosteroids; brimonidine; preservative-free artificial tears/ointment; topical cyclosporine A 1%; topical tacrolimus ointment; topical anesthetics; trifluridine; idoxuridine; gentamicin; pilocarpine; timolol; apraclonidine; epinephrine; dipivefrin
All Procedures: Cultures and diagnostic testing of conjunctival scrapings (adenovirus, HSV, chlamydia) including direct fluorescent antibody testing and McCoy cell culture; conjunctival scrapings with Dacron swab for PCR/DFA and inoculation into tissue culture transport medium; clinical observation and follow-up examinations every 2–3 weeks.
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up every 2–3 weeks until clinical improvement is noted; monitor closely for occult infection and for signs of progressive conjunctival scarring or ocular surface disease.
Patient Education: Stop the suspected offending eye drop (brimonidine) immediately. Use preservative‑free artificial tears or ointment for comfort and apply cool compresses as needed. Avoid topical corticosteroids or other eyedrops unless directed by your eye doctor. Return for follow‑up every 2–3 weeks until improvement is seen, and sooner if symptoms worsen (increasing pain, vision loss, marked redness, pus, or corneal changes). If the original medication is still needed, switch to a preservative‑free alternative. Early removal of the offending agent typically results in resolution over weeks; contact your provider if no improvement by 2–3 weeks.


CASE 03 — Acute Bacterial Conjunctivitis
========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Routine follow-up visit 15 months after penetrating keratoplasty; mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling.
DURATION: 15 months
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I had a fever and swollen glands, particularly on the right side of my face, about 6 weeks ago — my doctor thought it was 'strep throat' or 'mononucleosis'."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 38-year-old woman, 15 months post-right penetrating keratoplasty and anterior segment reconstruction, presents for routine follow-up with comfortable eyes but mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling. Six weeks earlier she had a febrile illness with right-sided swollen glands (internist suspected strep throat or mononucleosis); throat culture and EBV serology were negative and she was treated with oral penicillin for 14 days with symptomatic recovery except persistent preauricular lymphadenopathy. No ocular symptoms during that illness. Currently unilateral right ocular findings include visual acuity 20/60 improving to 20/40 with pinhole, IOP 28 mm Hg, mild lid puffiness and scurf, prominent follicles and papillae in inferior fornix and superior pretarsal conjunctiva, mild diffuse keratoplasty epitheliopathy; left eye essentially normal. On chronic topical ocular medications (loteprednol 0.5% BID, brimonidine 0.2% BID, timolol 0.5% gel BID, methylcellulose at bedtime). Denies other eye drop use, contact with animals, or travel; otherwise healthy. Symptoms improved significantly after starting topical trimethoprim–polymyxin B four times daily for 7 days.
History Narrative: A 38-year-old female patient presents for a routine follow-up visit 15 months after penetrating keratoplasty and anterior segment reconstruction for trauma to the right eye. Her eyes are comfortable, but she complains of mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling. She recalls that 6 weeks previously she developed a fever and swollen glands, particularly on the right side of her face, and her internist suspected “strep throat” or “mononucleosis.” She had no ocular symptoms at that time. Throat culture and Epstein–Barr virus serology were taken and were negative. She was treated with oral penicillin for 14 days, and she recovered symptomatically except for the persisting preauricular lymphadenopathy. The patient is otherwise healthy with a negative review of systems. Her past ocular history is also significant for medically treated traumatic angle recession glaucoma of her right eye. Her left eye is normal with no ocular history. Her ocular medications for the right eye were loteprednol etabonate 0.5% twice daily, brimonidine 0.2% twice daily, timolol gel-forming solution 0.5% twice daily, and methylcellulose at bedtime. She had last been seen 3 months previously, and no ocular inflammation was seen. Her current examination reveals a visual acuity of 20/60 + with pinhole to 20/40 in the right eye. Intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg in the right eye and 14 mm Hg in the left eye. She has a slightly tender right preauricular lymph node. External exam reveals slight puffiness of the lids, right worse than left. Biomicroscopy of the right eye shows mild lid scurf and no other lesions. The conjunctiva reveals prominent follicles and papillae in the inferior fornix and superior pretarsal area. No granulomas are present. The keratoplasty has mild diffuse epitheliopathy. The anterior segment exam is otherwise noncontributory. The left eye shows mild pretarsal papillae, without follicles, and an otherwise normal exam. She denied using any eye drops other than the prescription medications already listed. She denied close contact with animals, including cats and birds, and had not traveled to potentially endemic areas for other infectious etiologies. She denied gynecologic complaints and reported being monogamous.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Streptococcal pneumoniae acute bacterial conjunctivitis of the right eye with inflammatory pseudomembrane formation. Unilateral conjunctival injection with papillary and follicular response, mild lid scurf, mild diffuse keratoplasty epitheliopathy, elevated IOP in the right eye (28 mm Hg). Treated with topical trimethoprim–polymyxin B q.i.d. with significant improvement after 2 days. Differential includes viral follicular conjunctivitis, chlamydial inclusion conjunctivitis, toxic drug-related follicular reaction, and masquerade syndromes; laboratory testing (viral cultures, chlamydia culture and DFA) was negative, supporting bacterial etiology. Continued topical antibiotic therapy and conservative management recommended; monitor for escalation suggesting hyperacute or gonococcal infection.
Primary Diagnosis: Streptococcal pneumoniae bacterial conjunctivitis with inflammatory pseudomembranes
Secondary Diagnoses: 1. Penetrating keratoplasty (status post, right eye) 2. Traumatic angle recession glaucoma (medically treated, right eye) 3. Ocular hypertension (IOP 28 mm Hg in right eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis (adenovirus, HSV, EBV); Chlamydial (adult inclusion) conjunctivitis; Toxic/medication-induced follicular conjunctivitis; Conjunctival lymphoma (masquerade syndrome)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Corneal involvement including keratitis and risk of corneal perforation - Spread of infection to the other eye - Transmission to contacts - Rare systemic extension in severe cases (e.g., with gonococcal infection) - Formation of inflammatory membranes or pseudomembranes - Potential vision loss if severe or untreated


Plan
All Medications: loteprednol etabonate 0.5% (eye drops) twice daily; brimonidine 0.2% twice daily; timolol gel-forming solution 0.5% twice daily; methylcellulose (eye drops) at bedtime; oral penicillin (14-day course, previously); trimethoprim sulfate–polymyxin B drops four times daily for 7 days
All Procedures: Conjunctival scrapings for pathologic examination; viral cultures (HSV and adenovirus) from conjunctival scrapings; chlamydia culture on McCoy cells and conjunctival smear for DFA staining; treatment with topical trimethoprim–polymyxin B drops (medical therapy)
Follow-Up Instructions: Return to clinic if symptoms worsen, vision decreases, copious purulent discharge, increasing pain, or no improvement after 48–72 hours.
Patient Education: - Use prescribed topical antibiotic drops (trimethoprim–polymyxin B) four times daily for 7 days as directed. - Expect symptoms to improve within a couple of days; most cases resolve in 1–2 weeks. - Use warm compresses and artificial tears for comfort. - Avoid touching eyes and do not share towels, washcloths, or pillows while symptomatic to prevent spread. - Return sooner if symptoms worsen, vision decreases, pain increases, heavy purulent discharge, or if hyperacute signs (rapid worsening, copious discharge, marked eyelid swelling) occur. - If concerns about sexually transmitted infection or persistent/recurrent symptoms, testing and partner treatment may be indicated.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate emergency care for hyperacute symptoms—copious purulent discharge, marked eyelid swelling, severe pain, rapid vision loss, or signs suggesting gonococcal infection (risk of corneal involvement); do not delay—go to ER or ophthalmology urgently.

Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for medically managed pterygia is dictated by the severity of symptoms and the proximity to the visual axis; if topical steroids are used for inflammatory pterygia or during the postoperative period, earlier follow-up is indicated to assess response and to evaluate the intraocular pressure.
Patient Education: A pterygium is a benign, fibrovascular growth of the conjunctiva often related to UV exposure and chronic dry eye. If small and not causing symptoms it can be observed. To reduce irritation and slow progression, use preservative‑free artificial tears regularly and wear ultraviolet‑blocking sunglasses and wide‑brimmed hats outdoors. For active inflammation, a short course of topical steroid drops (typically four times daily tapered over 2–3 weeks) may be used under physician supervision; follow‑up is needed to monitor response and intraocular pressure. If the pterygium grows onto the cornea, induces astigmatism, causes vision loss, or produces unacceptable cosmetic or symptomatic problems, surgical removal can be offered but carries a risk of recurrence (commonly up to ~35–40% without adjuncts). Adjunctive measures (conjunctival autograft, amniotic membrane, or mitomycin C) can lower recurrence but have risks that should be discussed. Seek prompt care for rapid growth, atypical appearance, severe pain, or persistent redness/discharge.


CASE 05 — Recurrent Erosion/Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy
==================================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 32-year-old lifeguard with intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation; episodes consistent with recurrent epithelial erosions; visual acuity 20/20 OU.
History Narrative: A 32-year-old lifeguard with intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation; visual acuity 20/20 OU; slit‑lamp exam shows fibrovascular overgrowth of the bulbar conjunctiva extending onto the cornea of both eyes.
Symptom Onset: Intermittent (recurrent) — chronic episodes beginning prior to presentation (patient is 32)
Symptom Duration: Intermittent (chronic), present for an unspecified/recurring duration
Progression: Recurrent
Characteristics: Most common corneal dystrophy; map, dot, and fingerprint (map‑dot‑fingerprint) epithelial irregularities; autosomal dominant with female predominance; often bilateral; causes recurrent corneal erosions and irregular astigmatism/haze.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Eyelid traction on loosely adherent epithelium (dryness, lid rubbing/traction)
Alleviating Factors: Avoiding epithelial trauma; regular lubrication with nonpreserved artificial tears (4–8×/day) and nighttime ointment; hypertonic 5% sodium chloride drops during day and 5% ointment at night; bandage contact lens or self‑retained amniotic membrane grafts; pressure patching/antibiotic ointment and cycloplegia during acute episodes; surgical interventions (debridement, micropuncture, PTK) for recurrent cases.

Fundus Exam – Optic Nerve: Within normal limits


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome secondary to epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy) — bilateral involvement with intermittent red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation; visual acuity 20/20 OU; slit-lamp shows characteristic map and dot epithelial changes and diffuse epithelial sloughing consistent with recurrent erosions. Primary plan: acute management to promote epithelial healing and prevent infection (topical antibiotic ointment, pressure patch or bandage contact lens or self‑retained amniotic membrane as indicated, cycloplegia for pain), consider epithelial debridement if needed; for recurrent/recalcitrant disease discuss anterior stromal micropuncture or superficial PTK; long‑term lubrication with preservative‑free artificial tears and nocturnal ointment, and consider 5% sodium chloride drops/ointment for maintenance; follow closely for wound healing and infectious keratitis, consider corneal topography if vision affected by irregular astigmatism.
Primary Diagnosis: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (map‑dot‑fingerprint dystrophy)
Differential Diagnosis: Recurrent corneal erosion from epithelial basement membrane dystrophy; Traumatic recurrent corneal erosion; Infectious keratitis (superficial bacterial/viral); Dry eye–related epithelial breakdown
Severity: Mild to moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: delayed corneal wound healing; refractive changes; “tight lens” syndrome; secondary infectious keratitis; subepithelial scarring; recurrence of erosions


Plan
All Medications: topical antibiotic ointment cycloplegia soft bandage contact lens (not a medication) N/A self-retained amniotic membrane grafts (Prokera, AmbioDisk) N/A topical antibiotic ointment (post-debridement) cycloplegia (post-micropuncture) nonpreserved artificial tears artificial tear ointment (bedtime) 5% sodium chloride drops 5% sodium chloride ointment
All Procedures: - Epithelial debridement (manual scraping/peeling) - Bandage contact lens application - Self-retained amniotic membrane graft placement (cryopreserved Prokera or dehydrated AmbioDisk) - Pressure patching - Anterior stromal micropuncture (25‑gauge needle micropunctures) - Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK)
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful follow-up until epithelial defect resolution; monitor for infectious keratitis. After healing, maintain lubrication with nonpreserved artificial tears 4–8×/day and artificial tear ointment at bedtime. Consider 5% sodium chloride drops during day and 5% sodium chloride ointment at bedtime for ≥3 months as alternative/adjunct. Obtain corneal topography if irregular astigmatism or visual disturbance suspected.
Patient Education: Educate the patient that they have epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (map‑dot‑fingerprint) which commonly causes recurrent corneal erosions—episodes of pain, tearing, redness, and foreign‑body sensation that often recur and can affect either eye. Acute care focuses on protecting the surface and preventing infection (topical antibiotic ointment, patching or bandage contact lens, possible cycloplegia for pain); clinic‑placed self‑retained amniotic membrane grafts are an option. If erosions recur despite medical therapy, procedures such as gentle epithelial debridement, anterior stromal micropuncture, or phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) can produce longer symptom‑free periods. After healing, maintain frequent lubrication with preservative‑free artificial tears (4–8×/day) and ointment at night; hypertonic 5% sodium chloride drops/ointment may help adherence and reduce recurrences for several months. Be vigilant for increasing pain, discharge, worsening vision, or signs of infection and seek urgent care if these occur. Consider evaluation of the fellow eye and discuss potential hereditary risk to family members.
Emergency Instructions: Careful follow-up until the epithelial defect has healed; seek immediate ophthalmic care for increasing pain, worsening redness, decreased vision, discharge, or signs of infection (possible infectious keratitis). If severe pain or vision loss occurs, go to emergency department or eye emergency clinic promptly.


CASE 06 — Fuchs’ Corneal Dystrophy
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: sudden onset of unilateral pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision upon awakening
LATERALITY: OU
PATIENT QUOTES: "I awoke with sudden pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, light sensitivity, and blurred vision as soon as I opened my eyes."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 35‑year‑old woman with a history of multiple prior similar episodes awoke with sudden onset of unilateral pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening her eyes; symptoms began upon awakening with no antecedent trauma and have occurred in either eye previously.
History Narrative: A 35-year-old woman awoke from sleep with sudden onset of unilateral pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening her eyes. The patient had a previous history of multiple similar episodes occurring in either eye. The patient’s mother has also been affected with similar episodes. She had no history of prior ocular trauma. Visual acuity is 20/400 in the involved eye and 20/20 in the fellow eye. Slit-lamp examination of the involved eye revealed a large, discrete area of epithelial sloughing. The edges of the epithelial defect were remarkable for a “heaped-up” appearance. No infiltrate was apparent. Fluorescein dye revealed pooling over the epithelial defect. Examination of the fellow eye was remarkable for diffuse, superficial gray-white opacities in a “map” and “dot” configuration.
Symptom Onset: Upon opening her eyes while awakening (sudden upon awakening)
Progression: Slowly progressive
Characteristics: Slowly progressive endothelial dystrophy causing loss of endothelial cells and corneal guttata with stromal and epithelial edema (worse in morning) often with diurnal vision fluctuation, increased corneal thickness on pachymetry, familial occurrence, may be managed medically early (hypertonic saline, ointment, dehydration) and surgically with endothelial transplantation (DSAEK, DMEK) or PKP in advanced/scarred cases


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Morning (worse vision/diurnal vision fluctuation — symptoms worse upon awakening/morning blur)
Alleviating Factors: Using hypertonic sodium chloride (e.g., NaCl 5%) drops (especially upon awakening) and hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime; brief corneal dehydration with a hair dryer on low setting directed at the cornea at arm’s length for several minutes
Associated Symptoms: morning blur, diurnal vision fluctuation (worse vision in morning), pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision
Previous Episodes: Multiple similar episodes occurring in either eye
Impact on Daily Activities: Morning blur from corneal edema causing worse vision on awakening; may need drops/ointments or hair-dryer measures; progressive disease can significantly affect visual function requiring transplantation — moderate to severe visual impact, especially mornings.
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: Mother
Risk Factors: Age (older age), female sex, positive family history/genetic predisposition (autosomal dominant tendencies), endothelial cell loss/low endothelial cell density, corneal guttae, prior ocular surgery (risk for progression), cataract (coexisting lens changes)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 1. Fuchs’ corneal endothelial dystrophy OU — slowly progressive endothelial cell loss with guttata and variable stromal/epithelial edema causing diurnal visual fluctuation (worse in the morning). Corneal pachymetry likely increased; specular microscopy useful for endothelial assessment. Manage conservatively with hypertonic saline drops/ointment and ocular surface measures while monitoring progression. 2. Bilateral cataracts — lens opacities present OU; consider combined cataract extraction with endothelial intervention when vision is significantly affected. 3. Surgical considerations — when medical measures fail or visual function is significantly impaired, consider endothelial transplantation (DMEK preferred when applicable for better visual/refractive outcomes and lower rejection; DSAEK as alternative) for isolated endothelial dysfunction; consider penetrating keratoplasty if there is visually significant stromal scarring or concurrent advanced pathology. When planning endothelial procedures with cataract extraction, target slightly myopic IOL power to offset anticipated hyperopic shift (approx. +1.0–1.5 D with DSAEK). Postoperative care includes topical antibiotics and prolonged steroid taper, supine positioning after DSAEK/DMEK, and suture management/topography-guided astigmatism control after PKP.
Primary Diagnosis: Fuchs’ corneal dystrophy OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Cataract OU
Differential Diagnosis: Recurrent corneal erosion syndrome due to map‑dot‑fingerprint (epithelial basement membrane) dystrophy; Traumatic corneal abrasion; Other epithelial basement membrane dystrophies (Meesmann’s, Reis–Bücklers); Anterior stromal dystrophies causing recurrent erosion (lattice, macular, granular)
Laterality: OU
Complications: - Progressive corneal edema leading to bullous keratopathy - Decreased visual acuity (morning blur, progressive vision loss) - Corneal scarring (can limit postoperative visual outcome) - Graft rejection after transplantation - Graft failure or detachment (after DSAEK/DMEK) - Hyperopic shift after DSAEK (~1.0–1.5 D) - Accelerated cataract formation (especially after PKP)


Plan
All Medications: NaCl 5% ophthalmic solution (hypertonic sodium chloride) ointment (hypertonic sodium chloride) topical antibiotic drops topical corticosteroid drops nonpreserved artificial tears
All Procedures: Hypertonic sodium chloride drops (NaCl 5%) Hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime Use of a hair dryer to dehydrate the cornea (thermal desiccation) Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) Simultaneous cataract extraction with intraocular lens (IOL) placement Topical antibiotic drops (postoperative) Topical corticosteroid drops (postoperative) Ointments and/or nonpreserved artificial tears (ocular surface rehabilitation) Selective suture lysis and/or running suture adjustment (post-PKP astigmatism management) Rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting Astigmatic keratotomy, compression sutures, wedge resection, or repeat PKP (surgical astigmatism correction) Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) (post-suture removal refractive surgery)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Postoperative topical antibiotic and corticosteroid drops as prescribed; discontinue antibiotic after re-epithelialization. - Slowly taper topical steroid over 6–12 months. - Use ointments and/or nonpreserved artificial tears as needed to rehabilitate ocular surface; minimize preserved drops. - After DSAEK/DMEK: remain supine until air bubble resolves to allow graft attachment. - After PKP: manage astigmatism with selective suture lysis/running suture adjustment guided by topography; prescribe glasses or RGP lenses when appropriate. - Return for routine postoperative visits for epithelialization, graft position, IOP, and suture management; monitor long-term for graft rejection and cataract progression.
Patient Education: Fuchs’ endothelial dystrophy is a slowly progressive condition in which the cells that keep the back surface of your cornea clear gradually decline, causing corneal swelling and blurry vision — often worse in the morning. Early measures to reduce symptoms include using hypertonic saline drops (5% NaCl) when you wake and a hypertonic ointment at bedtime, and briefly directing a hair dryer on low from arm’s length toward the eyes to help evaporate surface fluid. Regular follow-up is important to monitor vision, corneal thickness, and cell status. If swelling progresses and vision is significantly affected despite these measures, surgical options to replace the diseased endothelial layer (DSAEK or DMEK) or, rarely, a full-thickness transplant (PKP) can restore clarity; these have different recovery times and risks which your surgeon will review. Also discuss cataract management if present, because combined procedures and intraocular lens power planning may be needed. If you notice suddenly worse vision, pain, or signs of infection, seek prompt care.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Keratoconus, bilateral but asymmetric, greater in the left eye. Patient has mild disease: poor spectacle/soft contact correction but achieves 20/30 with rigid gas-permeable lenses in the involved eye; right eye managed successfully with RGP. Potential for progression in left eye; discuss collagen cross-linking to halt progression and surgical options (INTACS, DALK, PKP) if contact lens intolerance, poor fit, progressive thinning, or central scarring occur. Continue contact lens rehabilitation and periodic monitoring with topography/pachymetry; consider surgical referral if vision or contact lens tolerance worsens.
Primary Diagnosis: Keratoconus
Differential Diagnosis: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy; Pseudophakic/aphakic bullous keratopathy; Corneal hydrops from keratoconus; Herpes simplex stromal keratitis
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: residual astigmatism, myopia, glaucoma, cataract, mydriasis, graft rejection


Plan
All Procedures: rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting; ultraviolet light/riboflavin corneal collagen cross-linking; intracorneal ring segment implantation (INTACS); deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK); penetrating keratoplasty (PKP)
Follow-Up Instructions: The left eye may eventually show changes consistent with keratoconus; continue rigid gas-permeable contact lens for the right eye and monitor the left eye for progression.
Patient Education: Keratoconus is a progressive thinning and bulging of the cornea that causes irregular vision. Early disease can often be managed with glasses or specialized contact lenses (rigid gas-permeable, scleral, or hybrid lenses) to improve vision. Collagen cross-linking (UV light + riboflavin) can strengthen the cornea and slow progression. If contact lenses no longer provide good vision or scarring occurs, surgical options include intracorneal ring segments (INTACS) to flatten the cornea or corneal transplantation (DALK or PKP); DALK preserves the patient’s endothelium and has fewer rejection risks. Regular follow-up with corneal measurements/topography and prompt care for changes in vision are important. If proceeding with cataract surgery, corneal thickness and endothelial health guide whether a combined endothelial procedure is needed.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Streptococcal corneal ulcer of the left eye with central dense stromal infiltrate and epithelial defect consistent with bacterial keratitis. Risk factors include probable contact lens wear. Corneal integrity at risk; vision threatened. Plan: aggressive topical broad‑spectrum antibiotic therapy (fortified antibiotics ± fluoroquinolone) with frequent dosing, obtain corneal scrapings for Gram stain, culture and sensitivities, consider subconjunctival antibiotics or hospitalization if severe or noncompliant, and use adjunctive measures (cycloplegia, doxycycline, enzyme inhibitors). Avoid topical steroids until adequate antimicrobial therapy and clinical improvement confirmed; if improvement occurs, consider cautious steroid taper per SCUT trial timing. Monitor closely for response and signs of thinning or impending perforation; if perforation or medical failure occurs, use tissue adhesive or perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty removing all infected tissue. Follow-up frequently until resolution and then address risk factor modification (halt contact lens use, treat lid/tear dysfunction) and consider optical rehabilitation for residual scarring.
Primary Diagnosis: Streptococcal corneal ulcer, left eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Seasonal allergies; Penicillin allergy; Contact lens wear
Differential Diagnosis: Bacterial keratitis (contact lens–associated); Acanthamoeba keratitis; Fungal keratitis
Severity: Central (severe)
Laterality: Left eye
Complications: - Corneal scarring leading to decreased vision - Corneal thinning and ectasia - Corneal perforation and globe compromise - Need for penetrating keratoplasty or other surgical repair - Graft failure or compromised long-term graft survival - Persistent irregular astigmatism - Recurrence of infection

All Procedures: Diagnostic stains, corneal culture and sensitivities, ultrasound pachymetry, computerized videokeratoscopy/topography (EyeSys, Pentacam), rigid gas permeable contact lens over‑refraction, slit‑lamp examination, dilation with posterior pole exam, topical fortified antibiotic therapy, topical fluoroquinolone therapy, subconjunctival antibiotic injection, intravenous antibiotics (hospitalization), topical corticosteroid drops (adjunctive), cycloplegics, doxycycline (matrix metalloproteinase inhibition), collagen shields impregnated with antibiotics, bandage contact lens, self‑retained amniotic membrane grafts, corneal glue, penetrating keratoplasty, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, conjunctival flap (not indicated), phototherapeutic keratectomy, contact lens rehabilitation (rigid gas permeable and scleral lenses)
Follow-Up Instructions: Once infection is successfully treated, evaluate and correct risk factors for recurrence ( discontinue or modify contact lens wear ), treat lid/lacrimal/conjunctival dysfunction as needed, and consider surgical options (rigid/scleral contact lenses, PTK, DALK/PK) for severe scarring.
Patient Education: Avoid wearing contact lenses until the infection has fully healed and follow strict contact-lens hygiene if resuming; recognize and report worsening symptoms (increased pain, redness, decreased vision, discharge, or light sensitivity) immediately. Adhere exactly to prescribed topical antibiotic regimen and return for follow-up so treatment can be adjusted based on cultures and clinical response. Do not use steroid drops unless specifically instructed by your ophthalmologist. Use prescribed cycloplegic drops for comfort if recommended, and expect possible need for additional treatments (glue, surgery, or corneal transplant) if the ulcer perforates or does not respond. Address modifiable risk factors (improve eyelid hygiene, treat dry eye or lid disease) to reduce recurrence risk.

CASE 10 — Postsurgical Corneal Edema
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: ocular irritation in both eyes
DURATION: 1 week
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have burning, foreign body sensation, a sandy-gritty feeling, and redness, more in my right eye. These symptoms are worse in the morning and later in the day and make me unable to read or drive comfortably. I still have preserved emotional lacrimation. I sleep on my stomach, preferring my right side."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus referred for a second opinion for ocular irritation in both eyes after cataract surgery, complaining of burning, foreign body sensation, sandy‑gritty feeling, redness (worse in right eye), symptoms worse in morning and later in day impairing reading and driving, reduced blink rate, preserved emotional lacrimation, sleeps on right side, reduced ocular sensitivity, tear breakup time <2s, superficial punctate and rose bengal staining, low tear meniscus, delayed fluorescein clearance, and decreased tear secretion; postop poor visual outcome in operated eye due to corneal edema with preexisting low endothelial cell density and final BCVA 20/20 after treatment.
History Narrative: A 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus presented with bilateral ocular irritation and a referral for a second opinion for presumed unstable ocular surface/dry eye in the right eye. He complained of burning, foreign body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, and redness, worse in the right eye, worse in the morning and late in the day, interfering with reading and driving. He had preserved emotional lacrimation and reported sleeping on his stomach, preferring his right side. Blink rate was reduced bilaterally. He had no external signs of rosacea, no palpable preauricular nodes, normal lid position and globe relationship, and loose/floppy lid tension (2+ right, 1+ left). Meibomian secretions appeared clear and easily expressible. Tear meniscus height was low in upper and lower lids both eyes. Tarsal and bulbar conjunctivae were diffusely injected with a mixed papillary and follicular response. Ocular sensitivity was markedly reduced by Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometry. Tear breakup time was <2 seconds OU. Fluorescein showed superficial punctate staining and rose bengal staining positive over the exposure zone, more prominent OD. Intraocular pressures were 15 mmHg OD and 16 mmHg OS. Fluorescein clearance test showed marked delayed dye clearance and decreased tear secretion in both eyes. Lens and fundus were unremarkable OU. Specular microscopy of the fellow eye showed low endothelial cell density without guttata; the operated eye had unexpected immediate postoperative corneal edema attributed to preexisting low endothelial density of undetermined etiology. He was treated with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline four times daily for one week, with complete resolution of corneal edema and final best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20.
Progression: Resolved


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Sleeping on his right side (prone/stomach sleeping) leading to exposure/more symptoms on that side, reduced blink rate, low tear meniscus/poor tear film (dry eye)
Alleviating Factors: Resolution of corneal edema after topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline four times daily for 1 week, resulting in final BCVA 20/20
Associated Symptoms: burning, foreign body sensation, sandy‑gritty feeling, redness, worse in morning and later in day, decreased reading/driving comfort, reduced ocular sensitivity, photophobia (implied by difficulty driving/reading)
Prior Treatments: topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution four times a day for 1 week

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 56-year-old man status post cataract extraction with immediate postoperative decreased vision due to corneal edema. Exam and specular microscopy of the fellow eye revealed low endothelial cell density without guttata, indicating preexisting endothelial dysfunction (likely non‑Fuchs, possibly related to diabetes). Differential included surgical endothelial trauma, toxicity, inflammation, and elevated IOP, but clinical course and fellow‑eye findings support low preoperative endothelial reserve as the cause. Treated medically with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline qid; edema resolved and final BCVA returned to 20/20. Surgical intervention deferred given resolution.
Primary Diagnosis: Postsurgical corneal edema
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Preexisting endothelial disease/dysfunction (e.g., Fuchs’ dystrophy, low endothelial cell density); surgical trauma to endothelium or Descemet’s detachment; toxic endothelial injury (intracameral agents, contaminants); postoperative IOP elevation causing endothelial decompensation
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: wound leak; flat anterior chamber; iris incarceration in the wound; IOP (intraocular pressure elevation); primary endothelial failure; endophthalmitis; epithelial defect; down-growth


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1%; topical corticosteroids; topical hyperosmotic 5% sodium chloride (solution or ointment); topical ophthalmic aqueous suppressants; topical antiglaucoma medications; systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; subconjunctival corticosteroid injection; preservative-free epinephrine (recommended); preservative-free lidocaine (recommended); antibiotics (topical or subconjunctival)
All Procedures: Topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone acetate 1% qid for 1 week) and topical hypertonic saline solution 5% qid for 1 week
Follow-Up Instructions: The patient was managed with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution four times a day for 1 week; follow up as needed to confirm resolution and final visual acuity (edema resolved and final BCVA 20/20).
Patient Education: - Corneal edema after cataract surgery is often temporary and can improve with time and treatment. - Risk factors include low endothelial cell density, Fuchs’ dystrophy, complicated surgery, diabetes, and certain medications or intraoperative toxic exposures. - Treatments aim to reduce inflammation, lower intraocular pressure if elevated, and draw fluid out of the cornea: frequent topical corticosteroids (eg, prednisolone acetate 1%), topical hypertonic saline (5% sodium chloride drops or ointment), and glaucoma medications or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors when needed. - Additional supportive measures: a therapeutic soft (hydrophilic) contact lens can improve comfort and vision in mild edema. - If edema persists despite medical therapy for 2–3 months, surgical options include endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK or DMEK) or, less commonly now, penetrating keratoplasty. - Report immediately: worsening vision, new severe pain, light sensitivity, increased redness, or sudden eye discharge. - Follow-up schedule: frequent visits initially to monitor inflammation, intraocular pressure, and corneal clarity; adhere to prescribed drops and return as instructed.


CASE 11 — Dellen
================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: right eye
PATIENT QUOTES: "decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year" "persistent blurred vision without major discomfort"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 55-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of decreased vision (worse at night) in both eyes; past ocular history unremarkable. He had diabetes mellitus for 10 years, well controlled on oral medications. Examination showed bilateral moderate nuclear sclerosis (left worse), best-corrected VA 20/50 OD and 20/100 OS, and cataract surgery was recommended for the left eye. Postoperatively after uncomplicated left phacoemulsification with temporal clear corneal incision and PCIOL, on postoperative day 1 his vision was 20/100 with IOP 18 mm Hg and slit-lamp showed diffuse central corneal edema and edema around the incision; he complained of persistent blurred vision without major discomfort.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year. Past medical history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus for 10 years, which had been well controlled with oral medications. Past ocular history was unremarkable. There was no family history of systemic or ocular diseases. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. Pupillary examination and ocular motility were unremarkable. The intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 12 and 13 mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively. There was no visual field loss by confrontation finger counting. Slitlamp examination was normal other than moderate nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens in both eyes, left worse than right. Fundus examination did not show any evidence of diabetic retinopathy. Potential acuity testing revealed a visual potential of 20/25 in each eye. A clinical diagnosis of cataract in both eyes was made and cataract surgery of the left eye was recommended for visual rehabilitation. The patient underwent an uncomplicated phacoemulsification via temporal clear corneal incision with implantation of a posterior chamber acrylic intraocular lens in the left eye. The visual acuity was 20/100 with an IOP of 18 mm Hg on the first postoperative day. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse corneal edema in the central cornea as well as around the incision site, and the patient complained of persistent blurred vision without major discomfort.
Symptom Onset: 1 year
Symptom Duration: 1 year
Progression: Relatively benign, usually nonprogressive but may persist or worsen if underlying causes (dry eye/adjacent elevation) untreated
Characteristics: Dellen are localized peripheral corneal thinning from desiccation of epithelial and subepithelial tissues adjacent to a limbal elevation (e.g., filtering bleb, dermoid, conjunctival elevation), noninflammatory, often well‑circumscribed, associated with interrupted tear film and dry eye, typically without stromal infiltration, may pool fluorescein, and usually benign but can progress if untreated.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: dry eye; inadequate tear distribution; lid disease (meibomitis, blepharitis); limbal elevation (filtering bleb, dermoid, conjunctival elevation/chemosis); meibomian gland dysfunction; post‑surgical conjunctival elevation
Alleviating Factors: - Lubrication with preservative-free artificial tears and bland ophthalmic ointment - Punctal occlusion - Treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction (warm compresses, lid massage, LipiFlow) - Bandage contact lens or self-retained amniotic membrane graft - Oral doxycycline and vitamin C (for prevention of keratolysis) - Secured amniotic membrane grafting and/or limited tarsorrhaphy for refractory cases
Associated Symptoms: Decreased vision (especially at night), persistent blurred vision, ocular surface dryness/discomfort from dry eye (e.g., irritation)
Impact on Daily Activities: Decreased vision (worse at night) in both eyes causing reduced visual acuity (20/50 OD, 20/100 OS) prior to surgery, with postoperative blurred vision in the left eye—moderate impact on daily activities, especially night driving and tasks requiring good visual acuity.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: - Inadequate tear distribution - Dry eye - Lid disease (meibomitis, blepharitis) - Presence of limbal elevation (e.g., filtering bleb, dermoid, conjunctival elevation after surgery) - Meibomian gland dysfunction/insufficiency - Postoperative conjunctival elevations (e.g., after muscle or scleral buckling surgery)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Delle in right eye due to localized corneal thinning from inadequate tear distribution/dry eye in the setting of an adjacent limbal elevation (filtering bleb).
Primary Diagnosis: Delle in right eye due to dry eye in the setting of a filtering bleb
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus (type 2), dry eye, meibomian gland dysfunction/blepharitis
Differential Diagnosis: Dellen (desiccation-related peripheral corneal thinning); Peripheral ulcerative keratitis from autoimmune/inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Mooren’s ulcer, vasculitis); Degenerative peripheral thinning (e.g., Terrien’s marginal degeneration, pellucid marginal degeneration)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: right eye
Complications: Dellen (peripheral corneal thinning) adjacent to a filtering bleb leading to localized corneal thinning and risk of progressive keratolysis; potential need for bandage contact lens, amniotic membrane graft, tarsorrhaphy, or surgical intervention if refractory.


Plan
All Medications: oral doxycycline; vitamin C; preservative-free artificial tears; bland ophthalmic lubricating ointment; topical punctal occlusion (procedural)
All Procedures: phacoemulsification with posterior chamber acrylic intraocular lens implantation; specular microscopy (noncontact or contact) of fellow eye; corneal pachymetry; punctal occlusion; application of preservative‑free artificial tears and ophthalmic ointment; oral doxycycline; oral vitamin C; bandage contact lens placement; self‑retained amniotic membrane graft; secured amniotic membrane grafting; limited tarsorrhaphy; surgical excision of offending conjunctival mass (e.g., pyogenic granuloma or dermoid); LipiFlow thermal pulsation for meibomian gland dysfunction
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe and treat long term for signs and symptoms of dry eye contributing to dellen formation; regular follow-up visits to monitor healing and check for progression or recurrence.
Patient Education: Dellen are localized areas of corneal thinning caused by poor tear coverage, often next to a raised area at the limbus (e.g., bleb or conjunctival mass). They are not the same as inflammatory ulcers but need monitoring. Treatment focuses on improving lubrication and tear stability: use preservative‑free artificial tears frequently, apply lubricating ointment at night, consider punctual occlusion if recommended, and treat lid disease (warm compresses and gentle lid massage for meibomian gland dysfunction). If thinning persists, additional measures (oral doxycycline and vitamin C, a bandage contact lens, or an amniotic membrane graft) may be needed; rarely, surgery (tarsorrhaphy or excision of a causative mass) is required. Return promptly for worsening pain, increasing redness, new discharge, a growing area of thinning, or any sudden vision change. Follow long‑term for dry eye management to prevent recurrence.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care if you develop sudden worsening pain, increased redness, a new or enlarging area of corneal thinning, any vision loss, a persistent epithelial defect, discharge, or signs of infection. If severe symptoms occur outside office hours, go to the nearest emergency department or eye urgent care.


CASE 12 — Graft Rejection Following Penetrating Keratoplasty
============================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision, red eye, photophobia, and foreign body sensation (new symptoms after PK)
DURATION: Two weeks
LATERALITY: OD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with a history of glaucoma status post multiple filtration procedures who underwent repeat trabeculectomy with a new flap at 7 o’clock producing a moderately elevated filtering bleb from 5 to 8 o’clock; two weeks postoperatively he developed peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to the filtering bleb with fluorescein pooling and a small area of epithelial cell loss.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man with a history of glaucoma that required multiple filtration procedures in the right eye was found to have elevated intraocular pressure on maximal medical therapy. A repeat trabeculectomy procedure was performed. In order to avoid the previous surgical site, the trabeculectomy flap was established at the 7 o’clock position, which resulted in a moderately elevated filtering bleb extending from the 5 to 8 o’clock positions. Two weeks after surgery, peripheral corneal thinning was noted adjacent to the filtering bleb. Fluorescein instillation revealed pooling with a small area of epithelial cell loss.
Symptom Onset: Two weeks after surgery
Symptom Duration: Two weeks
Characteristics: - Peripheral corneal thinning (delle): well-circumscribed, “saucerlike” with sloping edges; localized interruption of tear distribution adjacent to an elevation (e.g., bleb); epithelium usually intact at base but may show breakdown with chronic desiccation; fluorescein may pool in depression; rehydrates and thickens with viscous lubricant and patching resulting in resolution and mild localized stromal edema/opacification.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Broken sutures, suture abscess, perioperative/any inflammation (iritis, trauma), stromal vascularization, large/eccentric/repeat grafts, inadequate tear film (dry eye/meibomian gland dysfunction), adjacent elevated filtering bleb causing localized tear disruption
Alleviating Factors: Rehydration (application of viscous lubricating agent such as 1% methylcellulose or ophthalmic ointment and patching the eye), prompt topical corticosteroids for rejection, removal of broken sutures and prophylactic antibiotics, cycloplegic agents for comfort and blood–aqueous stabilization
Associated Symptoms: Photophobia, foreign body sensation, red eye, decreased vision
Prior Treatments: Multiple filtration procedures in the right eye; repeat trabeculectomy (with flap at 7 o'clock).
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — decreased vision, photophobia, foreign body sensation causing difficulty with reading, driving, and comfort until treated
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: stromal vascularization; large-diameter grafts; eccentric grafts; repeat grafts; any postoperative inflammation (iritis, trauma, epithelial or subepithelial rejection, broken sutures)

Laterality: OD
Complications: Broken suture with suture abscess; Endothelial corneal graft rejection


Plan
All Medications: 1% methylcellulose; ophthalmic lubricating ointment; Polytrim; bacitracin ointment; topical broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin); prednisolone acetate 1%; scopolamine 0.25%; oral prednisone (e.g., 80 mg daily); subconjunctival/transseptal triamcinolone (40 mg/mL); systemic cyclosporin A
All Procedures: repeat trabeculectomy; trabeculectomy; penetrating keratoplasty (PK); suture removal at the slit lamp; culture of suture abscess; topical antibiotic administration (e.g., Polytrim, bacitracin, topical fluoroquinolone); topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone acetate 1%); cycloplegic agent (scopolamine 0.25%); systemic corticosteroids (oral prednisone); subconjunctival/transseptal steroid injection (triamcinolone); repeat penetrating keratoplasty; Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK); perioperative prophylactic systemic steroids; perioperative cyclosporin A; ABO blood type matching
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up every 2–4 days for severe rejection or ~1 week for less severe cases until rejection is controlled, then less frequent visits as topical steroids are tapered with attention to visual rehabilitation (suture lysis, glasses, or rigid contact lens fitting as appropriate).
Patient Education: Seek immediate evaluation within 24 hours for any new photophobia, foreign-body sensation, red eye, or decreased vision; understand that timely treatment is critical to prevent irreversible graft damage. Broken sutures should be removed promptly and may require short-term topical antibiotic prophylaxis; report any persistent irritation or discharge. For endothelial rejection, expect intensive topical steroid treatment (possibly hourly) and close follow-up (every 2–7 days depending on severity); cycloplegics or systemic/subconjunctival steroids may be used for severe cases. Follow prescribed steroid tapering and attend scheduled follow-ups to monitor response and for visual rehabilitation (suture adjustments, glasses, or rigid contact lens as needed).
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate evaluation within 24 hours for any new photophobia, foreign body sensation, red eye, or decreased vision.


CASE 13 — Blepharitis
=====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: redness, photophobia, and blurred vision in the right eye for 1 week
DURATION: 1 week
LATERALITY: Right eye
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 30-year-old man with a history of right penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus 5 months prior presented with 1 week of redness, photophobia, and blurred vision in the right eye. He had prior right-eye VA 20/60 improving to 20/30 with pinhole one month earlier.

Mild cases: follow as needed or at next routine visit. Continue maintenance lid hygiene, artificial tears, and warm compresses; tailor regimen to symptoms.
Patient Education: Blepharitis is a chronic, relapsing eyelid condition; meticulous daily eyelid hygiene is essential (lid scrubs with a mild shampoo or commercial cleansers, warm compresses, gentle massage). Use preservative‑free artificial tears 4–8×/day for dry eye symptoms. Apply topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) at bedtime for severe staphylococcal blepharitis as directed. Short courses of topical steroids may be used for marked inflammation—follow-up is needed to monitor response and eye pressure. Avoid frequent/rough handling of the lids. Consider omega‑3 supplementation (1–3 g/day DHA/EPA) for meibomian gland dysfunction. Return in 3–6 weeks for reassessment or sooner if symptoms worsen or unilateral/refractory disease suggests possible underlying malignancy.

CASE 15 — Retained Lens Material after Cataract Extraction
==========================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Evaluation of a nearly mature cataract in the right eye with blurred vision and elevated intraocular pressure.
DURATION: 4 days
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 34-year-old Caucasian woman with a complex ocular history including a phthisical left eye and congenital glaucoma status post multiple prior surgeries in the right eye (goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, and trabeculectomy) was referred by a glaucoma specialist for evaluation of a nearly mature cataract in the right eye. She had progressive decreased vision in the right eye; visual acuity was count fingers in the right and no light perception in the left. On exam the right eye used a superior nasal peripheral iridotomy as an entrance pupil, had a functioning thick-walled superior nasal filtering bleb, IOP 20 mm Hg off medications, few corneal guttae, deep quiet anterior chamber, diffusely atrophic iris with 360° posterior synechiae preventing dilation (pupil ~3 mm) with multiple sphincterotomies and a large radial cut at 12 o’clock, a dense nearly mature cataract, absent zonules visible through the superior nasal iridectomy and questionable zonular status elsewhere, and no view of the right fundus.
History Narrative: A 34-year-old Caucasian woman was referred by a glaucoma specialist for evaluation of a nearly mature cataract in her right eye. She had a complex ocular history including a phthisical left eye and congenital glaucoma status post numerous surgical procedures in the right eye including goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, and a trabeculectomy. On examination, visual acuity was finger counting in the right and no light perception in the left. Examination of the right eye suggested that the patient was using her superior nasal peripheral iridotomy as an entrance pupil. There was a relatively thick-walled but functioning filtering bleb in the superior nasal quadrant. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 20 mm Hg without glaucoma medications. A few corneal guttae were observed. The anterior chamber was deep and quiet. The iris was highly atrophic throughout its entire periphery, with very little sphincter tissue. The pupil measured 3 mm and did not dilate due to 360 degrees of posterior synechiae. There were multiple sphincterotomies at the pupillary margin and a large radial cut at the 12 o’clock position. There was a dense, nearly mature cataract, an absence of zonules visible through the large superior nasal iridectomy, and questionable zonular status in the areas of broad peripheral iridectomies in two other quadrants. There was no view of the right fundus.
Symptom Onset: Several weeks after disruption of the lens capsule
Symptom Duration: Several weeks


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: eye pain, blurred vision
Prior Treatments: Numerous glaucoma surgeries in the right eye (goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, trabeculectomy); topical timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, topical atropine and prednisolone acetate prior to vitrectomy/lensectomy/IOL placement.
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate; initial vision reduced to counting fingers in affected eye with pain and elevated IOP limiting activities, improving postoperatively to 20/30 allowing normal daily activities.

Left eye: phthisical, no light perception.
Fundus Exam – Periphery: Flat


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Lens particle glaucoma secondary to retained lens fragments in the right eye following cataract extraction, with elevated IOP despite medical therapy, significant anterior segment abnormalities (360° posterior synechiae, atrophic iris, prior filtering surgery), dense nearly mature cataract and questionable zonular support; B-scan showed attached retina. Acute IOP elevation and need for IOL placement prompted surgical management—pars plana vitrectomy, lensectomy, and IOL implantation—performed 4 days after presentation, resulting in postoperative IOP normalization (12 mm Hg off medications) and good visual rehabilitation.
Primary Diagnosis: Lens particle glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Phthisical left eye; congenital glaucoma status post numerous surgical procedures (goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, trabeculectomy); corneal guttae; 7 D against-the-rule astigmatism; high axial myopia (axial length 30 mm)
Differential Diagnosis: Angle-closure glaucoma; Phacolytic glaucoma; Phacoantigenic (phacoanaphylactic) glaucoma; Iridocyclitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: glaucoma; inflammation; retinal detachment; hemorrhage; chronic inflammation; disabling visual floaters; refractory cystoid macular edema; secondary glaucoma


Plan
All Medications: timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, atropine, prednisolone acetate, topical beta-blocker, alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, glycerin, isosorbide, mannitol, prostaglandin analogs (not used), triamcinolone acetonide
All Procedures: pars plana vitrectomy; lensectomy; intraocular lens (IOL) placement; topical timolol; topical dorzolamide; topical brimonidine; topical atropine; topical prednisolone acetate
Patient Education: You have lens particle glaucoma from retained lens fragments after cataract surgery. Immediate goals are to lower eye pressure and reduce inflammation to protect your optic nerve. Treatment may include multiple eye-pressure drops (beta-blocker, alpha‑2 agonist, topical and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), frequent steroid eye drops, and cycloplegic drops to ease pain and prevent adhesions. If pressure or inflammation do not respond, pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy to remove the lens fragments (and placement of an intraocular lens if needed) is often performed—timing is individualized but commonly within days to weeks. Urgently return for worsening pain, sudden vision loss, new floaters, flashes, or a marked rise in eye pressure. Follow all medications exactly, attend scheduled follow-ups for pressure checks, and avoid activities that increase eye pressure until cleared.
Referrals: a glaucoma specialist

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 47-year-old man with history of bungee-cord trauma to the left eye and complicated left cataract surgery 9 months ago, lost to follow-up, presenting with a 2-month history of decreased vision, redness, and pain in the left eye.
History Narrative: A 47-year-old man with a history of bungee cord trauma to the left eye had undergone a complicated cataract surgery 9 months earlier. He was lost to follow-up and presented to the retina clinic with a 2-month history of decreased vision, redness, and pain in the left eye. His visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressures were 12 mm Hg OD and 38 mm Hg OS. Pupils were reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Right eye examination was unremarkable aside from a mild cataract. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the left eye revealed mild conjunctival injection, 2+ anterior chamber cell and flare, iridodonesis, ectopia lentis, and prolapsed vitreous. Gonioscopy of the left eye demonstrated a wide open angle with lens fragments noted inferiorly. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed a posterior vitreous detachment with his crystalline lens subluxated inferiorly in the anterior vitreous; macula, retinal vessels, and optic nerve were unremarkable.
Symptom Onset: 2 months ago
Symptom Duration: 2 months
Progression: Worsening over 2 months leading to decreased vision, redness, and pain in the left eye with elevated IOP (chronic progressive since surgery 9 months earlier)
Characteristics: Fibrin strands or dense fibrinous membrane over IOL/pupil; cellular AC reaction (2+ cell and flare) without hypopyon; presents days 2–14 post‑surgery; may cause decreased vision, redness, pain, photophobia; immune‑mediated from blood–aqueous barrier breakdown.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 47-year-old man with history of complicated left cataract surgery 9 months prior, now presenting with 2 months of decreased vision, redness, and pain OS. VA 20/400 OS, IOP 38 mmHg OS. Exam OS: mild conjunctival injection, 2+ AC cell and flare, iridodonesis, lens subluxation/ectopia lentis with prolapsed vitreous and lens fragments inferiorly on gonioscopy, and posterior vitreous detachment with subluxated crystalline lens in anterior vitreous on dilated exam. Findings consistent with postoperative fibrinous anterior chamber reaction on the IOL with secondary lens particle glaucoma causing markedly elevated IOP. Right eye unremarkable aside from mild cataract. Plan: aggressive topical corticosteroids (prednisolone acetate 1% q1–q6h depending on inflammation), consider intracameral tPA if fibrin persists, manage elevated IOP medically and consider washout/lens removal or surgical intervention for dislocated lens and retained lens fragments once inflammation controlled. Monitor for complications including infectious endophthalmitis, corneal edema, secondary glaucoma, and cystoid macular edema.
Primary Diagnosis: Postoperative fibrin deposition on the IOL
Secondary Diagnoses: Traumatic cataract with prior complicated cataract surgery; ectopia lentis (subluxated crystalline lens); prolapsed vitreous; elevated intraocular pressure/glaucoma (left eye, IOP 38 mm Hg)
Differential Diagnosis: Fibrinous postoperative anterior uveitis (fibrin deposition on IOL); Postoperative endophthalmitis; Lens-particle glaucoma (lens fragment–induced inflammation/IOP rise); Persistent intraocular inflammation from retained lens material or IOL malposition
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: AC turbidity, corneal edema, elevated intraocular pressure, bleeding, corneal toxicity, band keratopathy, endophthalmitis, posterior synechiae, loss of iris function, membrane formation on the IOL, IOL dislocation, glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, posterior capsular opacification, infectious keratitis


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (topical); topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (topical NSAID); systemic steroids; intracameral recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
All Procedures: Intracameral tPA injection; anterior chamber washout with fibrin membranectomy; removal of intraocular lens (IOL) if causative (IOL explantation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Regular eye examinations at regular intervals to monitor visual acuity, IOP, and for signs of infection or recurrent inflammation.
Patient Education: Fibrin on the intraocular lens is inflammation after eye surgery that can cause decreased vision, redness, pain, and light sensitivity. It usually appears days to weeks after surgery and is treated primarily with strong topical steroid drops (for example prednisolone acetate 1%) given frequently to reduce inflammation and restore the blood–aqueous barrier. In more severe or persistent cases, an injectable medication (intracameral tPA) can dissolve fibrin, but it carries risks (temporary corneal clouding, corneal edema or toxicity, raised eye pressure, bleeding, and infection). Rarely, surgery (anterior chamber washout or IOL removal) is needed if the IOL is causing ongoing inflammation or vision is significantly affected. Follow-up exams are important to monitor vision, eye pressure, and signs of infection or cystoid macular edema; contact your eye doctor right away for worsening pain, sudden vision loss, increasing redness, or discharge.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care if you develop sudden severe eye pain, marked vision loss, increasing redness, new discharge, flashes/floaters, or if your eye becomes more swollen; for sudden very high eye pressure symptoms (severe pain, nausea/vomiting, halos around lights) or signs of infection (fever, worsening pain) go to the emergency department or contact your eye surgeon/ophthalmologist right away.


CASE 17 — Subluxated Crystalline Lens
=====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Photophobia
DURATION: 5 days
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "photophobia"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman presented 5 days after combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye complaining of photophobia; she had undergone the same procedures in the left eye one month earlier.
History Narrative: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the eye clinic after intraocular surgery in the right eye, with a chief complaint of photophobia. Five days earlier, she had undergone combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye. Her left eye had undergone the same procedures 1 month prior to presentation. Her past medical history was significant only for hypertension. Her ocular medications were prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours and ofloxacin four times a day in both eyes. Her visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/200 OS. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed mild conjunctival injection with a low bleb. The cornea was clear. The anterior chamber had moderate cells and flare with no hypopyon. There was a meshwork of fibrin deposition on the IOL. Examination of the left eye revealed a low bleb, clear cornea, and rare cells in the anterior chamber. The IOL was in good position. Dilated fundus exam was unremarkable in both eyes except for moderate and severe glaucomatous cupping of the right and left optic nerves, respectively. The poor vision in the left eye was secondary to advanced glaucoma.
Symptom Onset: 5 days earlier
Symptom Duration: 5 days
Characteristics: Upward (superotemporal) lens subluxation associated with Marfan’s syndrome


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: Reclining the dilated patient so the lens falls back behind the pupil (and pharmacologic miosis to trap it posteriorly)
Associated Symptoms: Photophobia
Prior Treatments: combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in both eyes (right eye 5 days prior, left eye 1 month prior)
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant — visual impairment (photophobia, decreased acuity OD 20/60, OS 20/200) and postoperative inflammation likely interfere with reading, driving, and daily tasks, especially with OS advanced glaucoma causing poor vision.
Systemic Symptoms: tall stature, long thin extremities (arachnodactyly), joint laxity, pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis, decreased subcutaneous fat, and cardiac abnormalities (mitral or aortic valve disease, progressive ascending aortic dilation)
Recent Travel: No recent travel reported

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) associated with Marfan’s syndrome.
Primary Diagnosis: Lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) associated with Marfan’s syndrome
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Trauma (unilateral) including angle recession; Marfan syndrome (hereditary ectopia lentis); Homocystinuria (metabolic, downward subluxation); Pseudoexfoliation-associated zonulopathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Life-threatening cardiac abnormalities (aortic dissection, mitral/aortic valve abnormalities) associated with Marfan’s syndrome - Retinal detachment - Glaucoma (including angle‑closure from pupillary block) - Corneal endothelial cell loss and corneal decompensation from anterior dislocation - Amblyopia (in pediatric patients) - Vitreous prolapse - Intraocular hemorrhage - Endophthalmitis - Hypotony - IOL-related complications: optic tilt/decentration, pigment dispersion, unintended refractive error, suture degradation/breakage and scleral knot erosion, hemorrhage and haptic damage with intrascleral fixation


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours; ofloxacin four times a day
All Procedures: combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (right eye); combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (left eye, 1 month prior)
Follow-Up Instructions: Return to clinic for postoperative check within 1 week for IOP, anterior chamber inflammation, wound/bleb status, and IOL position; earlier evaluation sooner if increased pain, decreasing vision, photophobia, hypopyon, or signs of endophthalmitis. Continue topical prednisolone acetate 1% and ofloxacin as prescribed; taper steroids per postoperative protocol. Arrange ongoing glaucoma and retinal monitoring; consider echocardiography if Marfan’s suspected for systemic evaluation.
Patient Education: A subluxated (partially dislocated) lens means the natural lens has shifted because its supporting fibers (zonules) are weak or broken. Causes include trauma, age-related conditions, or inherited disorders like Marfan’s syndrome — if bilateral or unexplained, further medical evaluation (including heart testing) is important. Small shifts can often be managed without surgery using glasses, contact lenses, or pupil‑changing drops to reduce symptoms (double vision or glare). If the lens threatens the cornea, causes pupillary block/angle closure, significantly blurs vision, or risks other complications, surgery is recommended. Surgical options include phacoemulsification with special capsular support devices, or pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy; IOL placement may be in the bag, in the sulcus, sutured to the iris or sclera, or an anterior chamber/iris‑claw lens depending on support. After surgery, expect steroid and antibiotic eye drops, follow‑up visits to monitor inflammation, pressure, and IOL position, and report sudden pain, vision loss, increasing redness, or discharge immediately. If Marfan’s or another systemic condition is suspected, family screening and cardiology evaluation (echocardiogram) are recommended because of possible life‑threatening aortic or valve disease.
Referrals: Echocardiography for evaluation of aortic/valvular disease (cardiology)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Bilateral idiopathic congenital cataract — visually significant lens opacities present since infancy with high amblyopia risk. No medical treatment available; surgical extraction recommended early (bilateral by ~10 weeks) with consideration of timing of IOL implantation (usually avoided <1 year). Postoperative management requires prompt optical correction (glasses for bilateral aphakia or contact lens for unilateral), aggressive amblyopia therapy, and long-term surveillance for complications such as posterior capsular opacification and secondary glaucoma.
Primary Diagnosis: Bilateral idiopathic congenital cataract
Secondary Diagnoses: Marfan syndrome; Zonular dialysis (lens subluxation)
Differential Diagnosis: Congenital cataract; Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV/retrolental fibroplasia); Retinoblastoma; Coats’ disease
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: posterior capsular opacification; secondary membrane formation; glaucoma; retinal detachment


Plan
All Medications: atropine
All Procedures: Phacoemulsification of subluxated crystalline lens with insertion of capsule retractors, cortical cleanup, implantation of capsular tension ring (CTR) with scleral fixation using a Cionni/Malyugin-modified CTR (double-armed 9–0 polypropylene/CV‑8 Gore‑Tex suture through eyelet) and placement of three‑piece foldable IOL in ciliary sulcus with optic‑capsulorhexis capture
Follow-Up Instructions: Excellent refractive correction and appropriate occlusion (patching) therapy; if no IOL, immediate fitting with contact lenses or glasses (bilateral: glasses preferred with myopic target; unilateral: contact lens preferred); prolonged monitoring for glaucoma with long‑term follow‑up; frequent postoperative visits for refractive management and amblyopia therapy.
Patient Education: This chapter reviews congenital cataract: it can cause leukocoria and amblyopia if untreated; early detection and timely surgery (unilateral ~4–6 weeks, bilateral by ~10 weeks) improve outcomes but surgery before 4 weeks raises glaucoma risk. No medical cure exists; topical mydriatics (low‑dose atropine) may help selected central cataracts temporarily. Surgery in infants often requires posterior capsulotomy and close amblyopia therapy afterwards. IOLs are usually avoided under age 1 and targeted to leave initial hyperopia; risks include inflammation, membrane/capsular opacification, glaucoma (may occur years later), and retinal detachment. Postop rehabilitation requires prompt refractive correction (contacts for unilateral, glasses for bilateral) and intensive patching/occlusion therapy to prevent irreversible amblyopia. Long‑term follow‑up is essential for refractive changes and late glaucoma.

=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: shadow blocking her temporal vision
DURATION: 20-year history
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "a 'shadow' since her surgery, which was blocking her temporal vision."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: An 80-year-old woman with a 20-year history of glaucoma presented 8 months after combined cataract extraction, intraocular lens implant, and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye complaining of a temporal “shadow” since surgery that was blocking her temporal vision and causing near-miss driving incidents; vision in the affected eye was 20/30 and IOP 7 mm Hg.
History Narrative: An 80-year-old woman with a 20-year history of glaucoma presented for consultation 8 months following combined cataract extraction, intraocular lens implant, and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye. She complained of a “shadow” since her surgery, which was blocking her temporal vision. This was so debilitating that she almost ran over a small boy with her car. The visual acuity was 20/30 in the affected eye and the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 7 mm Hg. A large, ischemic filtering bleb was present with a negative Seidel’s test. The cornea was clear, the anterior chamber deep and quiet, and the cup-to-disc ratio was 0.8. The peripheral fundus was not visible due to a small and fibrotic pupil. A B-scan ultrasound was performed, which showed 360-degree ciliochoroidal detachments with serous fluid inside the detachments. There was a large nasal choroidal detachment that measured 8 mm. There was no retinal detachment overlying the choroidal detachment.
Symptom Onset: 8 months ago
Symptom Duration: 8 months
Characteristics: Ocular hypertension characterized by elevated intraocular pressure with normal-appearing optic nerves and visual fields, risk of progression to glaucoma, may be primary or secondary (e.g., pigment dispersion, pseudoexfoliation), assessed with gonioscopy, OCT, visual fields, pachymetry; management individualized based on risk factors and age.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Ocular hypertension — elevated intraocular pressure without evidence of glaucomatous optic nerve damage or visual field loss; patient is a glaucoma suspect for possible progression to primary open-angle glaucoma and should be monitored and considered for treatment based on risk factors and IOP level.
Primary Diagnosis: Ocular hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Idiopathic ocular hypertension; Primary open-angle glaucoma; Secondary glaucoma from pigment dispersion or pseudoexfoliation syndrome
Laterality: Right and left
Complications: large, ischemic filtering bleb with choroidal detachment (serous ciliochoroidal detachment)


Plan
All Medications: mitomycin C
All Procedures: combined cataract extraction with intraocular lens implant and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C; B-scan ultrasound; slit-lamp examination; gonioscopy; spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT); visual field testing (perimetry); pachymetry; laser trabeculoplasty; glaucoma filtration surgery; dilated optic nerve examination
Follow-Up Instructions: Initially every 6–12 months. Yearly visual field testing and/or OCT and dilated optic nerve exam. If started on IOP-lowering therapy, recheck within 4 weeks; after stability, exam every 4–6 months for ≥2 years. If stable long-term, every 6–12 months.
Patient Education: Explain that ocular hypertension means your eye pressure is higher than normal but your optic nerve and vision are currently normal, so you are being monitored as a glaucoma risk. Discuss risks and benefits of treatment versus observation, emphasizing individualized decisions based on age, risk factors (family history, race, corneal thickness), and potential side effects of medications. Recommend follow-up schedule: initial visits every 6–12 months (or sooner if treatment started), yearly visual field and/or OCT with dilated optic nerve exam, and if started on eye drops return in ~4 weeks to check pressure and then every 4–6 months while stable for at least 2 years. Advise to report new vision changes, increasing shadow/field loss, eye pain, or medication side effects promptly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 42-year-old Caucasian man with ocular hypertension and findings consistent with early primary open-angle glaucoma. Visual acuity 20/20 OU, IOPs 27 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS, gonioscopy 360° open to ciliary body band with moderate TM pigmentation, C/D 0.2 OU with intact neuroretinal rim, and 24-2 Humphrey fields without defects. No secondary causes identified. Impression: primary open-angle glaucoma (or ocular hypertension at high risk for POAG) requiring risk stratification (including CCT and RNFL imaging) and initiation of IOP-lowering management and close follow-up to achieve at least a 20% IOP reduction from baseline.
Primary Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG); Secondary open-angle glaucoma (pigmentary or pseudoexfoliation); Chronic angle-closure glaucoma; Optic nerve atrophy from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: OU


Plan
All Medications: β-blockers (selective and nonselective) topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prostaglandin analogs adrenergic agonists miotics apraclonidine 5-fluorouracil mitomycin C
All Procedures: Goldmann applanation tonometry Tonopen/pneumotonometer measurement Central corneal thickness measurement (ultrasound pachymetry, anterior segment OCT) Gonioscopy Dilated stereoscopic funduscopic examination (fundus contact lens, Hruby lens, 78-D/90-D lenses, red-free imaging) 24-2 Humphrey automated perimetry (automated static threshold visual field testing) Manual kinetic and static perimetry SD-OCT and other optic nerve head/retinal nerve fiber layer imaging (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, scanning laser polarimetry) Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) Laser peripheral iridotomy Trabeculectomy (with possible 5‑fluorouracil or mitomycin C) Seton implant surgery (Baerveldt, Molteno, Ahmed) Endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation Traditional transscleral cyclodestructive procedures (cryoablation/laser) Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (trabecular meshwork micro‑bypass stents, intracanalicular scaffolding devices, supraciliary microstents, ab interno trabeculotomy, ab interno canaloplasty, subconjunctival filtering devices) Stereoscopic optic nerve photography Panretinal photocoagulation (as indicated)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up frequency based on disease severity, target IOP achievement, evidence of progression, and duration of control; at each visit assess visual acuity, IOP, medication side effects and compliance; periodically evaluate optic nerve (stereoscopic photos/bio) and repeat visual field testing as indicated; adjust therapy for failure to meet target IOP, progressive optic nerve/visual field loss, or medication side effects/compliance issues.
Patient Education: You have primary open-angle glaucoma (high eye pressure with open drainage angles). Although your vision and optic nerves are currently normal, untreated high pressure can damage the optic nerve over time. Key points: - Purpose of treatment: lower eye pressure to a safe “target” (typically ≥20% below current pressures) to prevent future nerve damage. - Tests and monitoring: regular IOP checks, central corneal thickness measurement, gonioscopy, optic nerve examination (stereoscopic photos and/or OCT), and automated visual fields are needed to track for progression. - Medical therapy: eye drops (prostaglandin analogs, β-blockers, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, α-agonists, or miotics) are commonly used; often start in one eye to assess response. Take drops exactly as prescribed; report side effects and adherence problems. - Procedural options if needed: laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) can lower pressure and may be used before or instead of drops; trabeculectomy or tube shunts and minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries are options if medications/laser fail. Some procedures require pretreatment and short-term IOP checks after the procedure. - What to watch for: sudden vision changes, eye pain, severe redness, or signs of infection after any procedure — seek prompt care. - Lifestyle and follow-up: keep all scheduled visits and visual field/OCT testing; inform providers of other medical conditions or medications. Smoking cessation and general cardiovascular health are beneficial. You currently have 20/20 vision and no field or optic nerve damage, but ongoing monitoring and treatment adherence are essential to prevent future vision loss.

Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: Narrow anterior chamber angle, at risk for subsequent angle-closure glaucoma; Left eye: Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Mild emphysema
Differential Diagnosis: Primary pupillary-block primary angle-closure glaucoma; Plateau iris–related angle closure; Lens-induced (phacomorphic/aphakic/subluxation) angle closure; Secondary angle-closure (neovascular, uveitic, malignant glaucoma, choroidal effusion)
Severity: Narrow anterior chamber angle, at risk for subsequent angle-closure glaucoma (right); Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (left)
Laterality: OS


Plan
All Medications: inhalers (for emphysema); isosorbide; glycerol; intravenous mannitol; acetazolamide (IV and oral); topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; pilocarpine 2%; topical beta‑blockers; alpha‑2 agonists; prostaglandin analogs; topical corticosteroids; analgesics; antiemetics
All Procedures: Gonioscopy; Applanation tonometry; Slit-lamp examination; Funduscopic exam (optic nerve evaluation); Automated visual fields; Laser iridotomy (recommended/definitive therapy)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Measure IOP within 30–120 minutes after laser surgery. - Follow-up exam within 1 week. - Additional follow-up at 4–8 weeks postoperatively. - More frequent visits if response inadequate. - Taper topical corticosteroids during postoperative period. - Perform pupillary dilation with postdilation IOP check and gonioscopy to confirm angle remains open; consider provocative testing if needed.
Patient Education: You have acute primary angle‑closure glaucoma in your left eye and a narrow, at‑risk angle in the right eye. Immediate goals are to lower eye pressure, relieve pain/blur, and open the blocked drainage angle to prevent optic nerve damage. Initial treatment may include oral or IV medications (osmotic agents like isosorbide or mannitol, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), topical drops (pilocarpine to constrict the pupil if effective, beta‑blockers or alpha‑2 agonists), and topical steroids for inflammation. Definitive treatment is a laser peripheral iridotomy to create an alternate fluid pathway; the fellow eye usually gets a prophylactic iridotomy because half of such fellow eyes can have an acute attack within 5 years. You may need additional procedures (laser iridoplasty, goniosynechialysis, or cataract surgery) if angle closure persists or a lens contributes. Expect close follow‑up shortly after any laser/surgery (IOP check within 30–120 minutes, then within a week, and at 4–8 weeks) and temporary steroid drops. Seek immediate care for sudden eye pain, vision loss, nausea/vomiting, or worsening redness.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care for sudden eye pain, vision loss, severe headache, nausea or vomiting; go to nearest emergency department or urgent eye clinic for urgent IOP-lowering treatment (topical agents, systemic acetazolamide or osmotics as appropriate) and prompt definitive therapy (laser peripheral iridotomy).


CASE 22 — Pigmentary Glaucoma
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye
DURATION: several hours
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have had several hours of discomfort and my left eye is blurry."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 55-year-old woman presented with several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye. She reported decreased vision to 20/60 in the left eye; IOPs were 14 mm Hg OD and 52 mm Hg OS. The left pupil was middilated and sluggish. Onset was acute over several hours; associated symptoms included mild eye redness and corneal epithelial edema. No prior similar episodes documented in the history provided.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old woman presented with several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye. Vision was 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 52 mm Hg OS. The left pupil was sluggish and middilated. Slit-lamp exam of the left eye showed mild conjunctival and episcleral hyperemia, mild corneal epithelial edema, a shallow peripheral anterior chamber, and a markedly convex (bombé) midperipheral iris. The lens had mild nuclear sclerosis. Gonioscopy of the left eye revealed marked convexity of the iris contour with no visible anterior chamber angle structures; the right eye showed an open but narrow anterior chamber angle. The optic nerve cups were small in both eyes. The left eye was treated with medical therapy and laser peripheral iridotomy, which opened the anterior chamber angle and reduced the IOP to normal.
Symptom Onset: several hours
Symptom Duration: several hours
Progression: Moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma with progression evidenced by visual field defects (right: superior arcuate; left: early nasal step)
Characteristics: Secondary open-angle glaucoma affecting young myopic men with abnormal posterior iris bowing causing iris–zonule chafe, pigment dispersion (Krukenberg spindle, Sampaolesi’s line), densely pigmented trabecular meshwork, exercise-induced IOP spikes and blurry vision, responsive to medications, laser trabeculoplasty, and laser peripheral iridotomy.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Exercise (physical exertion), close work, emotional state, and ambient light level
Alleviating Factors: Laser peripheral iridotomy (which opened the anterior chamber angle and reduced IOP to normal) and medical therapy (IOP-lowering medications)
Associated Symptoms: discomfort, blurred vision, eye redness, colored halos around lights, blurry vision with exercise
Previous Episodes: several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye (no prior similar episodes mentioned)
Prior Treatments: medical therapy and laser iridotomy
Impact on Daily Activities: Likely mild-to-moderate limitation from intermittent blurry vision with exercise and risk of acute IOP spikes; may restrict strenuous activity and require frequent follow-up and treatment adherence.
Risk Factors: - Young age (most commonly affects young adults) - Male sex (affects men ≈2× more than women) - Myopia (typically myopic eyes) - Exercise (can induce pigment liberation and IOP spikes) - Family history of angle-closure glaucoma increases risk for angle-closure (not pigmentary) but noted as relevant in evaluation

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 55-year-old woman with acute left eye IOP spike to 52 mm Hg, mid-dilated sluggish pupil, corneal epithelial edema, conjunctival/episcleral injection, shallow peripheral anterior chamber and marked anterior bowing of the midperipheral iris with closed angle on gonioscopy. Right eye with open but narrow angle. Optic nerves with small cups. Left eye responded to medical therapy and laser peripheral iridotomy with opening of the angle and normalization of IOP. Impression: Left eye acute angle-closure attack with pupillary block (iris bombe) relieved by iridotomy. Coexisting features consistent with pigment dispersion in general discussion but current presentation and exam most consistent with primary angle-closure from pupillary block in the left eye; fellow eye narrow angle at risk — consider prophylactic iridotomy.
Primary Diagnosis: Pigmentary glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma; Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma; Uveitic (inflammatory) glaucoma; Intraocular/ocular melanotic lesions (ocular melanosis or melanoma)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: pilocarpine (miotic) prostaglandin analogs beta-blockers carbonic anhydrase inhibitors alpha-adrenergic agonists
All Procedures: medical therapy; laser iridotomy; gonioscopy; slit-lamp biomicroscopy; laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI); argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT); selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT); incisional glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy, Ex-Press shunt, glaucoma drainage implant); minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (iStent, gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy, endocyclophotocoagulation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up individualized to treatment response and disease stability; schedule visits based on effectiveness of therapy, severity of disease, and patient reliability.
Patient Education: Explain that pigmentary glaucoma is caused by pigment rubbing off the back of the iris, which can block drainage and raise eye pressure; it most commonly affects younger, myopic men but can occur in others. Describe symptoms to watch for—blurry vision, colored halos, eye pain, redness, and sudden vision changes with exercise—and advise seeking urgent care for sudden vision loss or severe pain. Explain diagnostic tests they may undergo: visual acuity, intraocular pressure checks, slit-lamp exam, gonioscopy, optic nerve evaluation, and visual fields. Review treatment options and goals: eye drops (to lower pressure), possible laser procedures (laser trabeculoplasty or peripheral iridotomy) to reduce pigment liberation or improve outflow, and surgery if needed; emphasize that treatment aims to lower pressure to prevent optic nerve damage. Discuss common side effects of typical medications (e.g., ocular irritation, blurred vision, systemic effects with beta-blockers) and the rationale for miotics historically. Advise avoiding vigorous exercise that provokes symptoms until controlled, and report new/worsening symptoms promptly. Emphasize the need for lifelong monitoring: regular IOP checks, optic nerve exams, and visual field testing; inform about frequency based on disease stability but stress adherence to follow-up and medications. Offer reassurance that many treatments control pressure and preserve vision when followed.
Emergency Instructions: Return to emergency department or ophthalmologist immediately for sudden vision loss, severe eye pain, nausea/vomiting, new halos, marked redness, or if eye drops/laser fail to lower IOP. If IOP remains very high or vision worsens, go to the ED now.


CASE 23 — Neovascular Glaucoma
==============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Routine eye examination.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 32-year-old myopic man presenting for routine eye examination with no complaints, denying significant past ocular or medical history; found to have elevated intraocular pressures (28 and 26 mm Hg) on applanation and on exam had vertically oriented pigment on corneal endothelium, numerous spokelike iris transillumination defects, fully open angles with dense trabecular meshwork pigmentation, RNFL thinning and visual field defects consistent with early/moderate glaucoma.
History Narrative: A 32-year-old myopic man presents for routine eye examination with no complaints and denies any significant past ocular or medical history. He has best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 OU, no afferent pupillary defect, and IOPs by applanation of 28 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Acute ocular hypertension secondary to neovascular glaucoma (NVG) due to anterior segment neovascularization; elevated IOPs requiring prompt medical lowering (oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, topical aqueous suppressants) with consideration of intravitreal anti‑VEGF and panretinal photocoagulation once posterior pathology evaluated; likely need for glaucoma filtering surgery (aqueous shunt) if IOP not controlled, with anti‑VEGF preoperatively to reduce bleeding risk; pain/inflammation control with topical steroids and cycloplegics; cyclodestructive procedures or enucleation reserved for blind, painful eyes.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute ocular hypertension secondary to neovascular glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Neovascular glaucoma; Acute angle-closure glaucoma; Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis; Traumatic/angle-recession glaucoma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Angle closure with permanent synechial closure - Marked intraocular pressure elevation leading to glaucomatous optic neuropathy/vision loss - Hyphema from fragile neovascular vessels - Intraoperative and postoperative bleeding during glaucoma surgery - Failure of filtering surgery (high failure rate) - Corneal edema from high IOP - Painful blind eye possibly requiring cyclodestruction or enucleation - Recurrent neovascularization and need for repeated anti-VEGF or interventions


Plan
All Medications: oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; topical beta-blockers; topical alpha-2 agonists; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; topical prednisolone; topical cycloplegics; prostaglandin analogs (use debated); intravitreal anti-VEGF agents; hyperosmotic agents (use with caution)
Follow-Up Instructions: Return for prompt panretinal photocoagulation and ophthalmology follow-up for glaucoma surgery evaluation; monitor IOP and retinal status; consider intravitreal anti‑VEGF prior to surgery.
Patient Education: - Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a serious form of glaucoma caused by abnormal new blood vessels in the eye that can block fluid drainage and raise eye pressure. - It often stems from underlying retinal ischemia (common causes: diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion); finding and treating the underlying cause is essential. - Urgent treatment is needed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) to protect vision and reduce pain; initial care often includes oral and topical pressure-lowering medications. - Anti-VEGF injections into the eye can rapidly reduce neovascularization and help control bleeding and inflammation before definitive treatment. - Laser treatment (panretinal photocoagulation) to ischemic retina is commonly used when the view permits to decrease the VEGF drive. - Many patients will require surgical drainage (glaucoma tube/shunt) because medical therapy alone is often insufficient; surgery has higher risk of bleeding when vessels are active. - If vision is already nonfunctional and painful, procedures to reduce pain (cyclodestruction, steroids, or, rarely, enucleation) may be considered. - Attend urgent and frequent follow-up visits; report sudden vision loss, severe eye pain, redness, or nausea/vomiting immediately. - Inform your doctor about systemic conditions (diabetes, vascular disease, sickle cell) and medications; some treatments (oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, hyperosmotics) may have risks or require precautions. - Keep blood sugar and vascular risk factors well controlled and have regular eye exams to detect high-risk changes early.
Emergency Instructions: Lower intraocular pressure immediately (oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ± topical aqueous suppressants such as beta-blocker, alpha‑2 agonist, topical CAI); consider topical steroid and cycloplegic for inflammation/pain; administer intravitreal anti‑VEGF once posterior causes like tumor/retinal detachment are excluded; consider anterior chamber paracentesis if pressure remains very high; arrange urgent ophthalmology/glaucoma referral for possible surgical intervention (aqueous shunt) and prompt panretinal photocoagulation when feasible.

Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: a bad headache on the right side of my head, extreme redness and light sensitivity of the right eye, and nausea (sick to my stomach)
DURATION: Half a day
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "a bad headache on the right side of my head." "a sick to my stomach." "pink eye." "colored halos around lights."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 72-year-old man with acute half-day onset of severe right-sided headache, extreme redness, photophobia, nausea and one episode of vomiting; reports abrupt, painless severe decline in vision in the right eye ~3 months earlier diagnosed as ischemic central retinal vein occlusion.
History Narrative: A 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of “a bad headache on the right side of my head.” He also notes extreme redness and light sensitivity of the right eye and feels “sick to my stomach.” His symptoms have developed quickly over half a day. Fearing that this may be more than “pink eye,” the emergency department physician requests that an ophthalmologist evaluate the patient. Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and arteriosclerosis. A review of systems is positive for nausea and one episode of vomiting. The patient had experienced an abrupt, painless, severe decline in vision in the right eye approximately 3 months earlier. He was diagnosed at that time with an ischemic central retinal vein occlusion by his ophthalmologist.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 72-year-old man with acute right eye pain, redness, photophobia, nausea/vomiting and markedly elevated IOP OD (67 mm Hg) with corneal edema, conjunctival injection, small hyphema, anterior chamber cell/flare, minimally reactive iris with fine irregular branching surface vessels and history of prior ischemic CRVO OD. Left eye WNL except hypertensive retinopathy and IOP 19 mm Hg. Gonioscopy limited OD by corneal edema; angle open OS. B-scan shows attached retina. Findings most consistent with neovascular (secondary) glaucoma of the right eye (NVG) likely due to prior ischemic CRVO, with concomitant herpetic anterior uveitis considered in differential given KP pattern and iris atrophy features. Diagnosis: secondary open-angle inflammatory glaucoma/NVG OD, with possible herpetic anterior uveitis contributing; left eye without acute disease.
Primary Diagnosis: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes; Arteriosclerosis; Ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (right eye); Hypertensive retinopathy (left eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Neovascular glaucoma from ischemic CRVO; Herpetic anterior uveitis (herpes simplex/zoster) with secondary glaucoma; Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis; Posner–Schlossman syndrome

All Procedures: gonioscopy slit-lamp examination B-scan ultrasonography ophthalmoscopy serologic workup body imaging topical corticosteroid administration (e.g., prednisolone 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%) topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., flurbiprofen, ketorolac, diclofenac) oral systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine) topical antivirals (trifluridine) oral antiviral therapy (acyclovir) cycloplegic agents (atropine, cyclopentolate) intraocular pressure-lowering topical medications (beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, adrenergic agonists, prostaglandin analogs) laser peripheral iridotomy surgical iridectomy trabeculectomy with antimetabolite (5-fluorouracil or mitomycin C) glaucoma drainage device implantation (e.g., Ahmed valve, Molteno implant) laser trabeculoplasty (contraindicated in active inflammation) laser cyclophotocoagulation
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequent follow-up with monitoring of inflammation and IOP; regular optic nerve exams and visual field testing; gonioscopy at each visit to assess for neovascularization or peripheral anterior synechiae; monitor for complications (CME, band keratopathy) and treat as needed; continue/adjust steroids to control inflammation despite risk of steroid-induced IOP elevation.
Patient Education: Your sudden severe eye pain, redness, light sensitivity, nausea, and very high eye pressure (67 mm Hg) are signs of a serious eye condition that can threaten vision. The likely cause is neovascular glaucoma (new abnormal blood vessels on the iris) related to your prior retinal vein occlusion. Key points you should know and do now: - This is an urgent problem: prompt treatment is needed to lower the eye pressure and control inflammation to prevent permanent vision loss. - You may need a combination of medicines: topical and/or oral pressure-lowering drugs, topical steroids to reduce inflammation, and dilating drops to lessen pain and prevent pupil adhesions. If herpetic infection is suspected, antiviral medication may be used. - If medications do not control the pressure or the eye remains inflamed, eye surgery (such as a glaucoma drainage device or filtering surgery) may be required. - Expect close, frequent follow-up visits for pressure checks, eye exams, and gonioscopy to monitor the angle and look for new vessels or synechiae. - Because some treatments (steroids) can raise eye pressure, your doctor will balance inflammation control with glaucoma management and adjust therapy as needed. - Report immediately any worsening pain, sudden vision loss, new floaters, or increased redness/nausea. - Share your full medical history (diabetes, hypertension, prior retinal vein occlusion) and all medications; systemic conditions can affect eye treatment and prognosis. If you have questions about the proposed medications or surgery, ask your ophthalmologist to explain the expected benefits, risks, and follow-up plan.

CASE 25 — Primary Congenital Glaucoma
=====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: blurry vision, photophobia, tearing, and pain of the left eye (2 days)
DURATION: 2 days
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "blurry vision, photophobia, tearing, and pain"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 38‑year‑old Caucasian man with a 2‑day history of blurry vision, photophobia, tearing, and pain of the left eye; prior ocular history notable for one episode of left herpes simplex keratitis 12 months earlier treated with trifluridine.
History Narrative: A 38-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 2-day history of blurry vision, photophobia, tearing, and pain involving his left eye.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 38-year-old Caucasian man with acute 2-day history of blurry vision, photophobia, tearing, and pain in the left eye. Ocular history notable for remote (12 months) left herpes simplex keratitis treated successfully with trifluridine. Exam: OD 20/20, OS 20/60 improving to 20/40 with pinhole. IOPs 12 mm Hg OD and 46 mm Hg OS. Left slit-lamp: fine stellate KPs diffusely, 2+ anterior chamber cells and flare, patchy iris sphincter atrophy on transillumination, deep AC, no posterior synechiae, clear lens. Gonioscopy: angles open to ciliary band OU with moderate TM pigmentation and prominent iris processes, no PAS. Fundus: clear vitreous, symmetric healthy optic discs. Impression: Acute unilateral inflammatory hypertensive episode of the left eye most consistent with herpetic anterior uveitis/keratouveitis leading to markedly elevated IOP. Prior history of HSV keratitis supports herpetic etiology. Secondary causes such as Fuchs or other uveitides less likely given acute painful presentation, KPs and iris atrophy. Management plan: urgent IOP-lowering therapy and anti-inflammatory/antiviral treatment tailored to presumed herpetic uveitis; close follow-up with IOP monitoring and consider glaucoma surgery only if IOP remains uncontrolled despite medical therapy.
Primary Diagnosis: Primary Congenital Glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Herpes simplex keratitis (history, left eye; resolved)
Differential Diagnosis: Primary congenital glaucoma; Peters anomaly (anterior segment dysgenesis); congenital corneal endothelial dystrophy (CHED); secondary glaucoma from uveitis or ocular tumor
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Unilateral (left)


Plan
All Medications: trifluridine eye drops; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide); brimonidine; selective beta‑blockers (topical, reduced 0.25% dose in young children); topical alpha‑2 agonists (contraindicated in infants) ; oral acetazolamide (5–10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours)
All Procedures: goniotomy; trabeculotomy; drainage device placement (Baerveldt shunt); trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (rare/with antimetabolite); cyclodestructive procedures; examination under anesthesia; anterior chamber examination including gonioscopy; A-scan ultrasonography; Tonopen/hand-held applanation IOP measurement; topical/ oral medical therapy administration (preoperative)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Topical cycloplegics and steroids for 1–2 weeks postoperatively. - Second exam under anesthesia at 8–10 weeks with repeat measurements; if IOP acceptable, dilate for disc photography and fundus exam. - Exams under anesthesia every 2–3 months until IOP stable or child can be examined in clinic. - Once examable in clinic: every 3–4 months, then extend to every 6 months when stable. - By age 3–4 years, routine office examinations.
Patient Education: Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a condition in infants/young children where high eye pressure causes enlarged, cloudy eyes, tearing, and light sensitivity. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment (goniotomy or trabeculotomy) are essential to protect vision. Before surgery, medicines (topical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; cautious low‑dose beta‑blocker use) may be used to lower pressure and clear corneal edema. Surgery is typically done under general anesthesia and often at the same time as the full exam under anesthesia. After angle surgery, short‑term steroid and cycloplegic eye drops are used; follow‑up exams under anesthesia are usually needed at 8–10 weeks and then every 2–3 months until the child can be examined in clinic. If pressure remains high after complete angle treatment, options include glaucoma drainage implants (preferred in infants) or, rarely, trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or cyclodestructive procedures. Long-term monitoring of eye size, corneal clarity, intraocular pressure, and optic nerve health is required; visual rehabilitation (amblyopia treatment, glasses) may be necessary. Seek urgent ophthalmic care for increasing cloudiness, tearing, photophobia, or eye enlargement.
Referrals: Pediatrician and anesthesiologist clearance for general anesthesia; surgeon experienced in pediatric angle surgery (for examination under anesthesia and operative treatment).

Follow-Up Instructions: Cycloplegic agents and conservative observation; if no improvement, autologous blood patch (attempted) followed by surgical revision with placement of additional scleral flap sutures; postoperative monitoring of IOP, axial length, refraction, and visual acuity with suture lysis as indicated (one month postrevision in this case) and long-term IOP follow-up.
Patient Education: Explain what ocular hypotony is, why it can happen after glaucoma filtration surgery, and the potential symptoms (blurred vision, shallow anterior chamber, light sensitivity). Emphasize steps in evaluation: history of medications, Seidel test for bleb leak, fundus exam for choroidal effusion, gonioscopy for cyclodialysis cleft, and ultrasound if media opaque. Advise immediate actions: stop all aqueous‑suppressing eye drops, use cycloplegic drops and topical corticosteroids as directed, and seek prompt ophthalmology follow‑up. Describe possible treatments depending on cause: observation for mild cases; bandage contact lens, autologous blood patch, or bleb compression for overfiltration; wound repair or scleral flap resuturing for persistent hypotony; reformation of the anterior chamber with viscoelastic if shallow. Explain risks of untreated hypotony (choroidal effusion, maculopathy, vision loss) and the importance of timely care. Provide return‑precautions: worsening vision, increasing pain, new floaters, or persistent drainage warrant urgent evaluation.


CASE 27 — PosttrabeculectomyWound Leak
======================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Worsening vision in the right eye for 1 year
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "worsening vision"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 45-year-old woman with aphakic right eye and history of inflammatory glaucoma, referred for surgical management. Preop vision 20/20 with aphakic correction, IOP 40 mm Hg on maximal medical therapy, CCT 535 µm, 1+ AC cell and flare, keratic precipitates, vitreous at pupillary plane, optic disc cupped to 0.9 with inferior notch and superior altitudinal field defect. Underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy; IOP 9–12 mm Hg first postoperative year. One year after surgery developed worsening vision to 20/60 (improved to 20/20 with +1.50 D), noted highly elevated avascular cystic bleb, moderate chorioretinal folds at posterior pole and macula, and IOP 3 mm Hg.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old woman with inflammatory glaucoma in her aphakic right eye was referred for surgical management. Her left eye had only light perception since birth from persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. Preoperatively, with aphakic correction her visual acuity was 20/20 and intraocular pressure (IOP) was 40 mm Hg on maximum medical therapy including oral agents. Central corneal thickness was 535 μm in each eye. The anterior chamber had 1+ cell and flare with scattered fine keratic precipitates and vitreous at the pupillary plane. The optic disc was markedly excavated with a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.9 with an inferior notch, and the visual field showed a superior altitudinal defect. A trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy was performed without incident. Postoperatively visual acuity remained 20/20 and IOP was 9–12 mm Hg for the first postoperative year. One year after surgery she presented with worsening vision: visual acuity was 20/60, which improved to 20/20 with a +1.50 D hyperopic correction. Exam showed a highly elevated, avascular, cystic bleb; moderate chorioretinal folds at the posterior pole and macula; and an IOP of 3 mm Hg.

CASE 29 — Flat Anterior Chamber
===============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Flat anterior chamber and elevated intraocular pressure in the right eye
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 53-year-old African American woman with advanced primary open‑angle glaucoma status post right limbus‑based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C; at 1 year postop IOP was at target with a moderately elevated diffuse ischemic bleb with microcysts. Three months later she presented with IOP 28 mm Hg, a deep anterior chamber but an almost flat filtering bleb; subsequently found to have central and peripheral shallowing of the anterior chamber with a patent peripheral iridectomy, no bleb or wound leak, not hypotonous, no choroidal elevation on funduscopy/ultrasound, and visible ciliary processes through the iridectomy — consistent with aqueous misdirection in the right eye.
History Narrative: A 53-year-old African American woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma and a target intraocular pressure of 15 mm Hg underwent a limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye. At 1-year postoperative visit the IOP was at target and a moderately elevated diffuse ischemic bleb with microcysts was present. Three months later she presented with IOP of 28 mm Hg; the anterior chamber was deep but the filtering bleb was almost flat. There was no bleb or wound leak and the eye was not hypotonous. A patent peripheral iridectomy was present with central as well as peripheral shallowing and no iris bombé. Funduscopy and ultrasound demonstrated no choroidal elevation, and the ciliary processes were easily visible through the iridectomy. These findings led to the diagnosis of aqueous misdirection in the right eye.
Symptom Onset: 3 months after the 1-year postoperative visit (i.e., 15 months after surgery)
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Progressive worsening until diagnosis of aqueous misdirection with elevated IOP (progressive)
Characteristics: Aqueous misdirection (ciliary block, malignant glaucoma): flat/very shallow central and peripheral anterior chamber despite patent iridectomy; normal or elevated IOP (may be normal initially); no choroidal effusion/hemorrhage; occurs after intraocular surgery (often in eyes predisposed to angle-closure, short axial length); forward rotation of ciliary body with anterior displacement of lens/vitreous; visible ciliary processes through iridectomy; not responsive to iridectomy alone.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Short axial length/angle‑closure anatomy, prior laser or incisional glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy), discontinuation of cycloplegics, use of miotics, eyes predisposed to angle closure (phakic eyes)
Alleviating Factors: Cycloplegic–mydriatic therapy (e.g., atropine 1% ± phenylephrine 2.5%), topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, oral/IV osmotic agents, intracameral viscoelastic injection, laser disruption of anterior hyaloid/posterior capsule (Nd:YAG), argon laser ciliary process ablation, and pars plana vitrectomy with anterior vitreous/ hyaloid removal
Associated Symptoms: Flat (very shallow) central and peripheral anterior chamber; elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) of 28 mm Hg; absence of iris bombé; patent peripheral iridectomy; no choroidal elevations on funduscopy/ultrasound; bleb almost flat (reduced bleb height)
Prior Treatments: limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C (right eye)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 53-year-old African American woman s/p trabeculectomy OD with MMC now presenting with a flat anterior chamber centrally and peripherally, IOP 28 mm Hg, a low/flat filtering bleb without wound leak, patent peripheral iridectomy, visible ciliary processes through the iridectomy, and no choroidal elevations on funduscopy/ultrasound. Findings and clinical course are most consistent with aqueous misdirection (ciliary block/malignant glaucoma) of the right eye. Medical management with cycloplegics (atropine 1% and phenylephrine 2.5%), topical and oral aqueous suppressants, and consideration of osmotic therapy was initiated; if refractory, anterior hyaloid disruption with Nd:YAG laser or pars plana vitrectomy with anterior vitreous removal and anterior chamber reformation are recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Aqueous misdirection
Differential Diagnosis: Aqueous misdirection (ciliary block/malignant glaucoma); Overfiltration with hypotony; Serous choroidal effusion; Pupillary block
Severity: Advanced
Laterality: Right
Complications: Aqueous misdirection (malignant glaucoma) leading to a flat/shallow anterior chamber with potential elevated IOP, possible need for medical therapy, laser or pars plana vitrectomy; risk of recurrence and need for prolonged cycloplegia


Plan
All Medications: Atropine 1% ophthalmic; Phenylephrine 2.5% ophthalmic; Topical aqueous suppressants (e.g., beta-blocker or prostaglandin—unspecified); Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (unspecified); Oral or intravenous osmotic agent (unspecified); Intracameral viscoelastic (unspecified)
All Procedures: limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C
Follow-Up Instructions: Maintain cycloplegia (e.g., atropine 1% daily) long-term as directed; avoid miotics; monitor IOP and anterior chamber depth regularly; if vitrectomy performed, cycloplegia may be discontinued cautiously in phakic eyes; in fellow eye perform prophylactic laser iridotomy and avoid miotics; return promptly for recurrence of shallowing, pain, or IOP rise.
Patient Education: Aqueous misdirection (also called ciliary block or malignant glaucoma) is a rare complication after eye surgery where fluid is pushed backward into the vitreous, causing the front chamber of the eye to become very shallow and the pressure to rise. Signs to watch for: worsening vision, eye pain, redness, and a very shallow or flat front chamber despite a surgical iridectomy. Initial treatment is medical: strong eyedrops to dilate and rotate the lens/ciliary body (e.g., atropine), medications to lower fluid production (topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor), and sometimes oral or IV osmotics; do not use miotic drops (they can worsen the problem). If drops and lasers don’t work, procedures (YAG laser or vitrectomy) may be needed to disrupt the anterior vitreous and restore normal fluid flow. If you have had this diagnosis, take drops exactly as prescribed, avoid miotics, report any sudden vision change, severe pain, or increased redness immediately, and attend all follow-up visits because recurrence is possible and further surgery may be required.


CASE 30 — Persistent Choroidal Detachment
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Persistent choroidal detachment
DURATION: 1 day
LATERALITY: Right eye
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 53-year-old woman with bilateral chronic angle-closure glaucoma who presented 1 day after a mitomycin trabeculectomy with a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, reduced vision (right eye 20/400, left 20/40), anterior chamber cells 3+, peripheral iridocorneal contact to within 1 mm of the pupil and central shallowing with a posterior chamber IOL 0.5 mm posterior to the endothelium; right eye IOP 34 mm Hg, left 12 mm Hg; filtration bleb elevated and Seidel-negative on the right; B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye showed a flat retina and no choroidal effusions.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Persistent serous choroidal detachment.
Primary Diagnosis: Persistent serous choroidal detachment
Differential Diagnosis: Overfiltration/bleb leak; Serous choroidal effusion; Suprachoroidal hemorrhage; Retinal detachment
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Persistent serous choroidal detachment


Plan
All Medications: mitomycin, topical steroid, topical cycloplegic agent, topical beta-blocker, topical aqueous suppressants, systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., oral acetazolamide), oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, balanced salt solution (BSS), viscoelastic, subconjunctival antibiotics, subconjunctival steroids
All Procedures: mitomycin trabeculectomy; surgical iridectomy confirmed patent; B‑scan ultrasonography of the right eye; slit‑lamp examination; Seidel’s testing; paracentesis with anterior chamber reformation (BSS/viscoelastic) and anterior chamber maintainer placement; radial conjunctival incision and 2–3 mm sclerostomy with suprachoroidal drainage and sclerostomy punch; conjunctival closure with absorbable suture; subconjunctival antibiotic and steroid injection; postoperative topical steroid, antibiotic, and cycloplegic therapy.
Follow-Up Instructions: Examine 1 day postoperatively; place on a brief course of topical steroid, topical antibiotic, and cycloplegic (if phakic); monitor for persistent effusion or drainage and confirm prompt resolution and visual recovery.
Patient Education: Choroidal effusions are fluid collections under the choroid that can occur after glaucoma surgery. They often cause a shallow front chamber and may lower vision if large. Most resolve on their own with observation and measures to raise eye pressure slightly (stopping some glaucoma medicines in the affected eye and sometimes the fellow eye). Your surgeon may recommend topical steroid and cycloplegic drops to reduce inflammation and comfort; systemic steroids are generally not used. If the effusion causes persistent vision loss, lenticulocorneal touch, or corneal/retinal folds, a simple drainage procedure can be performed to remove the fluid with rapid visual recovery. Report increasing pain, sudden vision loss, or redness immediately, and expect close follow-up until the fluid resolves.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Clinically significant diabetic macular edema, center-involving (ci‑CSME) OU. Early proliferative diabetic retinopathy, OS. Systemic history notable for 10 years of type II diabetes, hypertension, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatitis C. Visual acuity 20/20 OU. Slit-lamp exam unremarkable. IOP 11 mm Hg OD, 12 mm Hg OS. Fundus: bilateral intraretinal hemorrhages in multiple quadrants, cotton‑wool spot superior to right macula; no macular lipid or neovascularization OD. FA: microaneurysms with mild perifoveal capillary dropout, no leakage consistent with neovascularization. Plan: initiate anti‑VEGF therapy for center‑involving DME OU (three monthly injections to start), consider focal/grid laser for non–center involving areas or adjunctive therapy as needed; monitor closely and reassess for PRP in OS if progression of proliferative changes; optimize systemic control (blood pressure, lipids, glycemic control) and coordinate medical management. Follow‑up in 4–6 weeks with OCT and clinical exam; consider switching anti‑VEGF or intravitreal corticosteroid in poor responders after three injections.
Primary Diagnosis: Clinically significant diabetic macular edema, center-involving (ci-CSME) OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Peripheral neuropathy; Hepatitis C; Early proliferative diabetic retinopathy, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Clinically significant diabetic macular edema (DME) — center-involving; Hypertensive retinopathy with macular edema; Cystoid macular edema (postoperative)
Severity: Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (moderate NPDR)
Laterality: OU


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab ranibizumab aflibercept intravitreal corticosteroids (unspecified) argin laser (argon)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in 4–6 weeks after anti‑VEGF (with or without focal laser); if persistent or recurrent edema retreat at that interval. Consider a series of 3 injections before changing therapy; if poor response after 3 consecutive injections, consider switching anti‑VEGF or intravitreal corticosteroid. Repeat laser can be considered 3–6 months after initial treatment. Monitor closely for progression of proliferative disease and adjust PRP timing as needed.
Patient Education: You have clinically significant diabetic macular edema (DME) affecting the center of both eyes. This means fluid has collected in the central part of your retina (the macula) and can threaten vision if not treated. Key points and recommendations: - Cause and risk factors: DME is a complication of diabetes; poor blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol increase risk and reduce treatment response. Control of these conditions is important. - Symptoms to watch for: blurred or distorted central vision, difficulty reading or recognizing faces. Report any sudden vision changes immediately. - Recommended treatment: First-line therapy for center-involving DME is intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (medicines injected into the eye) given initially as a series (commonly three injections at 4–6 week intervals) and then repeated as needed based on response. Laser treatment may be used in non–center-involving DME or combined with injections in some cases. Steroid injections are an alternative for certain eyes (e.g., pseudophakic or poor responders) but carry risk of increased eye pressure or cataract. - Monitoring and follow-up: Regular eye exams with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visits every 4–6 weeks during active treatment to assess response. Longer-term follow-up is needed; multiple treatments may be required. - When surgery is considered: If OCT shows vitreomacular traction causing the edema, a vitrectomy may be recommended. - Systemic care: Work with your primary care physician/endocrinologist to optimize blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Smoking cessation and general cardiovascular risk reduction improve outcomes. - Prognosis: Many patients improve with anti-VEGF therapy, but some fluid may persist and multiple treatments are often necessary. Early treatment and good systemic control improve chances of preserving vision. If you have questions about the injection procedure, risks (infection, bleeding, increased eye pressure), or scheduling, please ask so we can provide details and consent information.
Referrals: Medical consultation for optimization of systemic conditions (primary care/internal medicine or cardiology)

Management to date: bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for macular edema, with planned continued anti-VEGF and focal laser to the right eye for unresolved edema; left eye observed given regression/resolution of edema and stable visual acuity. No vitreous hemorrhage present. Continued close follow-up and consideration of panretinal photocoagulation for PDR as indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (right eye) with high-risk characteristics; moderately severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (left eye)
Secondary Diagnoses: Type I diabetes mellitus, diabetic macular edema OU, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, nuclear sclerotic lens changes (trace)
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy (proliferative vs nonproliferative); Branch or central retinal vein occlusion with collateral vessels; Radiation retinopathy; Hypertensive retinopathy
Severity: Proliferative
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Pain in the immediate posttreatment period - Vitreous hemorrhage - Decreased night vision / diminished illumination - Peripheral visual field loss (usually not clinically significant) - Exacerbation or worsening of diabetic macular edema - Early persistent visual loss (≥2 lines)


Plan
All Medications: insulin (for type I diabetes), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) intravitreal injections (bilateral)
All Procedures: Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections OU; focal (macular) laser photocoagulation OD; scheduled follow-up exams; (planned potential third anti-VEGF injection OU)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe within a few weeks after completion of PRP; follow-up PRP and/or anti‑VEGF if retinopathy progresses or neovascularization regression is incomplete; conservative observational follow‑up if retinopathy regresses and vision is stable; consider vitrectomy for progression (recurrent vitreous hemorrhage or traction threatening macula).
Patient Education: Educated about proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the need for prompt treatment (panretinal photocoagulation and/or intravitreal anti‑VEGF) to reduce risk of severe vision loss, the role of anti‑VEGF for macular edema and when vitreous hemorrhage limits laser, potential need for multiple treatments and possible vitrectomy if hemorrhage or traction occurs, expected side effects/complications (pain after PRP, temporary decreased night vision, peripheral field loss, possible worsening of macular edema, risk of vitreous hemorrhage), importance of close follow‑up and monitoring with OCT/clinical exam, and strict systemic risk‑factor control (good glycemic, blood pressure and lipid management).


CASE 34 — Retinal Arterial Occlusion
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Second opinion regarding possibility of diabetic retinopathy; asymptomatic.
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 50-year-old man with sudden visual loss in the right eye; asymptomatic at initial presentation to ophthalmologist seeking second opinion for possible diabetic retinopathy. History notable for 5-year type II diabetes mellitus. Examination later showed findings consistent with an inferotemporal branch retinal artery occlusion in the right eye.
History Narrative: A 50-year-old man with a 5-year history of type II diabetes mellitus presented for a second opinion from an ophthalmologist regarding the possibility of diabetic retinopathy. The patient was asymptomatic upon initial presentation. His examination showed vision of 20/20 in each eye. Pressures were 12 and 13 mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Slit-lamp examination was unremarkable and the lenses were clear. On funduscopic exam of the right eye there were mild hard exudates scattered about the posterior pole, questionable neovascularization elsewhere at the distal portions of both temporal arcades, and definite neovascularization at the disc exceeding one disc area. In the left eye there were intraretinal hemorrhages with microaneurysms in all four quadrants, exceeding standard photograph 2A for hemorrhages in two quadrants.
Characteristics: Retinal edema with retinal whitening and a classic foveal "cherry-red spot"; visible Hollenhorst plaque; limited filling of the affected branch retinal artery on fluorescein angiography; subsequent inner retinal atrophy on OCT.


Subjective (cont.)
Impact on Daily Activities: Minimal to none — the patient is asymptomatic with 20/20 vision in each eye, so daily activities are not impacted.
Systemic Symptoms: Asymptomatic
Risk Factors: Type II diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis (systemic vascular disease), carotid artery plaque/stenosis, cardiac arrhythmias (emboligenic sources), hypertension (inferred as common vascular risk)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Branch retinal artery occlusion, right eye — acute retinal arterial ischemia with visible Hollenhorst plaque and inferotemporal arterial branch occlusion on fundus exam and fluorescein angiography. Vision better prognosis than CRAO; patient has diabetes mellitus type II (5 years) as systemic risk factor. Recommend urgent systemic vascular workup (carotid evaluation, cardiac rhythm monitoring, atherosclerotic risk factor management) and close ocular follow-up to monitor for retinal and iris neovascularization; consider acute intraocular pressure–lowering maneuvers if within 24 hours and discuss potential interventions (paracentesis, ocular massage) though no proven therapy to improve long-term visual outcome.
Primary Diagnosis: Branch retinal artery occlusion, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Type II diabetes mellitus, carotid artery atherosclerosis (suspected), systemic vascular disease (atherosclerosis)
Differential Diagnosis: Central retinal artery occlusion; Branch retinal artery occlusion; Retinal vein occlusion (central or branch); Ocular ischemic syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Neovascularization (retinal and possible iris/rubeosis), vitreous hemorrhage, macular edema, inner retinal atrophy leading to permanent visual field defects and hemifield loss, increased risk of stroke/MI from systemic vascular disease.


Plan
All Medications: acetazolamide; topical intraocular pressure–lowering drops; calcium channel blockers; anticoagulation; fibrinolytic agents
All Procedures: digital pressure on the globe (15-second compressions with sudden release); lowering intraocular pressure (intravenous acetazolamide, topical IOP-lowering drops, anterior chamber paracentesis); inhalation of carbogen (5% CO2/95% O2); retrobulbar or systemic calcium channel blockers; full-scatter panretinal photocoagulation; fluorescein angiography; spectral-domain optical coherence tomography; stereoscopic fundus photography; slit-lamp biomicroscopy with precorneal lens contact evaluation
Follow-Up Instructions: Monitor for subsequent neovascularization with regular ophthalmic follow-up; reinforce and ensure control of systemic vascular risk factors as prescribed by the patient’s internist.
Patient Education: Retinal arterial occlusion is a sudden blockage of an artery in the eye that can cause sudden vision loss; it is often a warning sign of systemic vascular disease (like atherosclerosis, carotid plaque, or heart arrhythmias). Immediate actions may include maneuvers to try to dislodge an embolus (digital ocular massage, lowering intraocular pressure with drops, IV acetazolamide, or anterior chamber paracentesis if within 24 hours), but no therapy reliably restores vision. You need urgent medical evaluation and systemic workup (carotid imaging, cardiac evaluation, vascular risk-factor assessment and management). Follow-up eye exams are important to monitor for neovascularization; if new vessels develop, panretinal photocoagulation can be effective. Control vascular risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, smoking cessation) as advised by your internist to reduce risk of stroke or heart attack. Low-vision aids and rehabilitation (including prisms for certain field defects) can help if vision does not recover.
Referrals: Referral for systemic medical workup (internist) for evaluation of systemic vascular disease, carotid plaque assessment, and cardiac rhythm evaluation (e.g., arrhythmia/embol source).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: CRVO OD with secondary macular edema — 69‑year‑old woman with acute, unilateral central retinal vein occlusion of the right eye, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages in all four quadrants, tortuous vessels, and OCT-confirmed marked intraretinal/macular edema correlating with decreased vision. History notable for hypertension and diabetes; risk factor modification recommended (cessation of oral contraceptives, systemic evaluation with primary physician). IOPs normal; no afferent pupillary defect. Plan: treat macular edema with intravitreal anti‑VEGF or corticosteroid injections guided by OCT; monitor monthly for 6 months for neovascularization/rubeosis and consider PRP if ischemia ≥5 disc areas or if rubeosis develops. Consider systemic workup as indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: CRVO with secondary macular edema, OD
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus; Early nuclear sclerosis of the lens; Prior/oral contraceptive use; Aspirin therapy (80 mg daily)
Differential Diagnosis: Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO); Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or hemiretinal vein occlusion; Diabetic retinopathy with diffuse hemorrhages; Subhyaloid or subretinal hemorrhage
Laterality: Right
Complications: Macular edema; neovascularization (rubeosis iridis) leading to neovascular glaucoma; vitreous hemorrhage; vision loss (reduced visual acuity); potential media opacities requiring cryopexy or vitrectomy; secondary glaucoma requiring shunt placement


Plan
All Medications: aspirin 80 mg daily; intravitreal triamcinolone; intravitreal anti-VEGF agents; oral contraceptives (cessation recommended)
All Procedures: Cessation of oral contraceptives; recommendation of aspirin 80 mg daily; referral for systemic evaluation/primary care coordination; monthly ophthalmic follow-up for 6 months; consideration of intravitreal anti-VEGF or intravitreal triamcinolone injections for macular edema; panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) if ≥5 disc areas of nonperfusion or rubeosis iridis; glaucoma surgery with shunt device if neovascular glaucoma and medical/laser control fails; possible vitrectomy or cryopexy if media opacity prevents laser.
Follow-Up Instructions: Monthly follow-up examinations for 6 months after diagnosis; thereafter routine follow-up with markedly reduced rubeosis risk after 1 year unless conversion to nonperfused occurs.
Patient Education: You have a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in your right eye causing macular swelling that can reduce vision. Important points: - Control systemic risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes) and stop oral contraceptives as recommended; follow up with your primary care physician. - Macular edema is often treatable; intravitreal anti-VEGF or steroid injections can reduce swelling and often improve vision. Initial frequent injections (every 4–6 weeks) are common, then spaced if improved. - There is a risk of neovascularization and neovascular (rubeotic) glaucoma, usually within 3–6 months, so monthly eye exams for at least 6 months are recommended to detect early signs. - If significant retinal ischemia or rubeosis develops, panretinal photocoagulation (laser) and/or anti-VEGF may be needed; if pressure rises, glaucoma surgery or shunt placement may be necessary. - Report any sudden worsening of vision, eye pain, or redness immediately.
Referrals: Referral to the patient’s primary care physician/internist for systemic evaluation (hypertension/diabetes management and discontinuation of oral contraceptives)
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care if sudden worsening of vision, eye pain, redness, or new floaters; return promptly for monthly follow-up for 6 months (or sooner if symptoms) to monitor for neovascularization and rising intraocular pressure.


CASE 36 — Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion
=======================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision in the right eye for 3 weeks
DURATION: 3 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I've had decreased vision in my right eye for about three weeks."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 45‑year‑old woman with a 3‑week history of gradual decreased vision in the right eye that worsened during the first week then stabilized; no hypertension, on oral contraceptives. Best corrected VA 20/100 OD, 20/20 OS; right afferent pupillary defect; pseudophakic; IOPs 12 and 14 mm Hg. Fundus with segmental intraretinal hemorrhages and macular edema involving the fovea. Prior treatments: intravitreal triamcinolone (initial and repeat) with recurrent edema, subsequently maintained on intravitreal bevacizumab every ~3 months with stable OCT and VA 20/30.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of decreased vision in the right eye. Her only medication was oral contraceptives and she did not have hypertension. Vision gradually diminished during the first week after onset then stabilized. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/20 OS. She had a right afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp exam showed no iris neovascularization; she was pseudophakic with a clear posterior capsule. Intraocular pressures were 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Funduscopic exam OD showed intraretinal hemorrhage distributed throughout each quadrant with mild disc edema, but no definite collaterals; macular edema involved about one disc area at the fovea. Cup-to-disc ratio was 0.3. Left eye exam was normal. Fluorescein angiography showed good perfusion in the midperiphery and late dye leakage at the fovea. OCT showed marked central macular edema. Intravitreal triamcinolone was administered with resolution of edema and vision improvement to 20/30 at 3 months, but edema recurred at 6 months requiring a second triamcinolone with recurrence at 3 months; she was then maintained on intravitreal bevacizumab about every 3 months with stable OCT and visual acuity of 20/30.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: BRVO (branch retinal vein occlusion) of the right eye with macular edema causing decreased vision to 20/100 OD at presentation. No iris neovascularization; 1+ disc edema and intraretinal hemorrhages in a segmental inferotemporal distribution with macular edema involving the fovea on OCT. Initial good response to intravitreal triamcinolone with recurrence treated again, subsequently maintained on intravitreal bevacizumab approximately every 3 months with stable OCT and vision improved to and maintained at 20/30 OD. No evidence of neovascularization or vitreous hemorrhage; IOPs normal. Recommend continued intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy with OCT monitoring and systemic risk factor management.
Primary Diagnosis: BRVO with macular edema, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy; Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO); Radiation retinopathy; Sickle cell retinopathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: macular edema; intraretinal hemorrhage; retinal neovascularization; vitreous hemorrhage; disc edema; epiretinal membrane; tractional/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; neovascular glaucoma


Plan
All Medications: oral contraceptives; intravitreal triamcinolone; intravitreal bevacizumab; aflibercept; aspirin
All Procedures: Intravitreal triamcinolone injection; Intravitreal bevacizumab injections (serial, ~every 3 months); Focal/grid macular laser photocoagulation; Sectoral/scatter retinal laser photocoagulation; Vitrectomy with membrane peeling (for epiretinal membrane or nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage); Vitrectomy for tractional/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; Optic nerve sheath decompression (experimental); Surgical decompression/lysis of common adventitial sheath (experimental)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow every 3–6 months initially; institute intravitreal therapy (often every 4–6 weeks) for macular edema then extend interval based on response; perform segmental scatter photocoagulation if retinal neovascularization is detected; consider vitrectomy for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or vision‑threatening traction.
Patient Education: Explain that a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a blockage of a small retinal vein causing retinal hemorrhage and macular swelling that can reduce vision. Control vascular risk factors (especially blood pressure; inform your primary care doctor). Treatment options aim to reduce macular edema and prevent neovascular complications and include intravitreal injections (anti-VEGF agents or corticosteroids) to improve or stabilize vision, and sectoral or focal laser if unwanted neovascularization or persistent edema occurs. Regular follow-up with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and eye exams is needed (initially every 4–6 weeks while receiving injections, then less frequently when stable). Report any new floaters, sudden vision loss, or pain promptly. Use of aspirin or other systemic treatments should be discussed with your primary care physician.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Nonexudative (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration, OU — chronic drusen with RPE atrophic changes causing central visual loss greater in degree than ophthalmoscopic pigmentation alone would predict; no evidence of choroidal neovascularization on OCT/FA. Patient endorsed monitoring and AREDS2 supplementation; low-vision rehabilitation discussed. Follow-up recommended every 3–12 months and prompt return for any new metamorphopsia or visual change.
Primary Diagnosis: Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration, OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Branch retinal vein occlusion (left eye); history of central retinal vein occlusion (right eye); hypertension (well controlled)
Differential Diagnosis: Occult exudative (neovascular) AMD; Pattern dystrophy (macular dystrophies, e.g., Stargardt); Inflammatory or traumatic RPE changes (including prior trauma/uveitis); Optic neuropathy or coexisting vascular occlusive disease (BRVO/CRVO)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OU
Complications: - Progression to exudative (neovascular) AMD (conversion to choroidal neovascularization) - Geographic atrophy with central vision loss - Persistent visual impairment / decreased visual acuity - Need for low vision rehabilitation - Possible fellow-eye involvement and bilateral disease


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab; aflibercept; intravitreal triamcinolone; AREDS2 vitamin supplementation; antihypertensive medications (unspecified)
All Procedures: Intravitreal bevacizumab injection; intravitreal aflibercept injections (every ~6 weeks for ~1 year); intravitreal triamcinolone injections; fundus photography; fluorescein angiography; optical coherence tomography (OCT); fundus autofluorescence (as diagnostic); low vision evaluation (low vision aids); Amsler grid testing; routine ophthalmic examinations (every 3–12 months).
Follow-Up Instructions: Examination every 3–12 months depending on stability; use Amsler grid daily and monitor each eye for new metamorphopsia or visual changes; return promptly for any increased metamorphopsia or other visual symptoms.
Patient Education: - Use an Amsler grid daily to check each eye separately for new distortion or scotomas; report any sudden changes (increased distortion, new blind spots) immediately. - Take AREDS2 vitamin supplements if advised (intermediate or advanced AMD or neovascular AMD in the other eye) and avoid tobacco smoking. - Attend regular follow-up visits every 3–12 months as recommended; more frequent if symptoms change. - Optimize lighting and consider low-vision evaluation and aids (magnifiers, focused lighting, telescopes) for tasks as needed; expect palliative benefits, not cure. - Be aware that development of sudden metamorphopsia or vision loss may indicate conversion to exudative AMD requiring urgent care.
Referrals: Low vision evaluation / low vision services
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic evaluation if you notice any sudden change in vision, new or worsening central visual distortion (metamorphopsia), a new central scotoma, sudden loss of vision, new flashes/floaters, or any other acute visual symptoms.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization OU secondary to myopic degeneration, with active occult CNVM in the right eye (pigment epithelial detachment and adjacent subretinal fluid on OCT; FA with delayed stippled hyperfluorescence and late leakage) and nonexudative myopic changes in the left eye (drusen/lacrimal cracks without macular fluid). Right eye treated with intravitreal bevacizumab; plan for 4-week follow-up with OCT monitoring and serial anti-VEGF as indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization secondary to myopic degeneration, OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Pseudophakia OU; Retinal lattice degeneration OU; Lacquer cracks (superior macula LE); Axial high myopia (≈ -10 D)
Differential Diagnosis: Pathologic myopia with myopic CNVM; Age-related macular degeneration (neovascular AMD); Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome–related CNV; Traumatic choroidal rupture with secondary CNV
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OU
Complications: - Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subretinal fluid and hemorrhage - Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy - Fuchs’ spot (subfoveal scarring) - Lacquer cracks leading to CNV - Retinal detachment (increased risk with lattice degeneration) - Macular schisis - Visual loss / central vision impairment


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab
All Procedures: Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in 4 weeks after intravitreal anti‑VEGF injection; thereafter interval may be extended based on response and stability with OCT at each visit to assess for macular fluid or recurrence. Monitor central vision at home with an Amsler grid and seek prompt ophthalmologic evaluation for new distortion or central metamorphopsia.
Patient Education: Patients should monitor central vision with an Amsler grid and promptly report any new distortion or central metamorphopsia. Follow-up after anti‑VEGF injection is typically at 4 weeks, then individualized based on response; OCT is usually performed at each visit to detect macular fluid or schisis. For nonexudative myopic degeneration, routine follow-up about twice yearly is recommended. Discuss low‑vision aids (high‑plus lenses, magnifiers, telescopes, video magnification) and referral for low‑vision rehabilitation as needed.
Emergency Instructions: Return for urgent evaluation if new distortion or central metamorphopsia, or any sudden vision loss; seek ophthalmologic consultation immediately.

Secondary Diagnoses: Myopia (high, -10 D) ; Choroidal neovascular membrane (right and left) ; Glaucoma ; Retinal pigment epithelial atrophy ; Retinal lattice degeneration
Differential Diagnosis: Serous retinal detachment from posterior scleritis;Choroidal neoplasm (e.g., choroidal melanoma/nevus with serous detachment);Choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) from myopic degeneration or AMD;Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left eye
Complications: scotomas; subretinal neovascularization (choroidal neovascular membrane); expansion of laser burns (after treatment); persistent RPE mottling/atrophy leading to chronic visual disturbance


Plan
All Medications: Propine; beta‑blocker (topical); corticosteroids; rifampin; methotrexate; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; metoprolol; propranolol; ketoconazole; mifepristone; eplerenone; spironolactone; finasteride; anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections
All Procedures: Argon blue-green laser photocoagulation (left eye) Krypton laser photocoagulation (left eye)
Follow-Up Instructions: CSCR resolves spontaneously in 60–80% of patients within 3 months; monitor for resolution and recurrences (recurrence 18–50%, 20% contralateral involvement). Consider observation for up to 3 months; if persistent/chronic, consider photodynamic therapy or focal laser to leakage point. Stop systemic corticosteroids if possible. Follow-up with clinical exam and OCT/FA as needed.
Patient Education: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a condition where fluid builds up under the central retina (macula), causing blurred or distorted central vision. It often affects young to middle‑aged adults and commonly improves on its own within about 3 months. Risk factors include corticosteroid use, stress/type‑A personality, pregnancy, hypertension, and certain medications. What to expect - Most cases resolve spontaneously; vision often improves but may not return completely and pigment changes can remain. - Recurrence is common (18–50%) and the other eye may be affected in ~20% of patients. Self-care and steps you can take - Avoid systemic or topical corticosteroids if possible—discuss alternatives with the prescribing physician. - Reduce stress and consider counseling or stress‑management techniques. - Report any sudden worsening, new distortion, or central vision loss promptly. Tests and monitoring - You may need OCT and fluorescein (and sometimes indocyanine green) angiography to confirm diagnosis and monitor fluid. - Repeat exams and imaging will be scheduled until the fluid resolves and to detect recurrence. Treatment options (if fluid persists or for occupational needs) - Observation for up to ~3 months initially. - Focal laser or photodynamic therapy (PDT) to the leakage site for chronic or persistent CSCR; PDT has better evidence for resolving subretinal fluid. - Some oral medications (e.g., mineralocorticoid antagonists) are being studied but lack definitive randomized trial proof of benefit. When to call the clinic - New or worsening central blur, increased distortion/metamorphopsia, or sudden vision loss. Follow‑up - Regular follow‑up with OCT/clinical exam until resolution; discuss lifestyle and medication changes to reduce recurrence risk.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: ERM secondary to previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment, right eye. Symptoms: subacute decreased vision and metamorphopsia. Exam/OCT: preretinal hyperreflective membrane with foveal contour distortion and retinal thickening. Management: observed when mild; indicated vitrectomy with ERM peel (±ILM peel) when BCVA falls to ~20/40–20/60 or with significant metamorphopsia. Patient underwent vitrectomy and ERM removal; at 3 months postop VA improved to 20/60 with marked reduction in metamorphopsia and no recurrent ERM on exam/OCT (decreased foveal thickness, improved contour). Prognosis: good, with typical visual recovery over 3–6 months and low recurrence risk.
Primary Diagnosis: ERM secondary to previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment
Differential Diagnosis: Cystoid macular edema; Vitreomacular traction from partial posterior vitreous separation; Hypotony-related retinal folds (hypotony retinopathy)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: retinal detachment; progressive nuclear sclerosis (cataract formation)


Plan
All Medications: Topical corticosteroid drops; topical antibiotic drops
All Procedures: Vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel (with internal limiting membrane peel performed or removed along with ERM in many cases)
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative topical corticosteroid and antibiotic drops; routine follow-up with monitoring of visual acuity and OCT over the first 6 weeks, with maximal improvement by 3–6 months; monitor for complications (retinal detachment, cataract progression) and manage cataract surgically if needed.
Patient Education: An epiretinal membrane (macular pucker) is a thin layer of tissue on the retinal surface that can cause blurred vision and distortion (metamorphopsia). Many ERMs are stable and can be safely observed if vision and symptoms are mild. Surgery (pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peel, sometimes with internal limiting membrane peel) is recommended if vision declines to about 20/40–20/60 or worse, or if distressing distortion occurs despite good acuity. Surgery often improves vision and distortion but recovery may take 3–6 months; risks include retinal detachment and accelerated cataract formation in phakic eyes. There is no effective medical therapy for idiopathic or post–retinal-break ERMs. Follow-up with visual acuity, Amsler grid checks, and OCT monitoring is advised; report any sudden worsening, new flashes, or floaters promptly.

CASE 43 — Vitreous Hemorrhage
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye for 3 months, interfering with driving and reading
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 78-year-old woman with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye, interfering with driving and reading.
History Narrative: A 78-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye interfering with driving and reading abilities. The vision was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated clear cornea, absence of cataract, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Fundoscopic examination showed focal areas of adherent posterior vitreous to the macula associated with raised retinal tissue, OD, and a nonspecific loss of foveal reflex, OS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in OD demonstrated a hyperreflective layer correspondent to the posterior hyaloid partially attached to the macula, leading to elevation and distortion of the retina. The OCT OS also showed focal vitreomacular attachment with distortion of the inner foveal layers. An intravitreal ocriplasmin injection was performed OD without improvement in vision or OCT appearance after 1 month. A pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed OD with release of the vitreomacular traction (VMT) and improvement of the foveal contour. The vision was 20/30 OD 1 month postoperatively. The OS has remained unchanged with vision of 20/40 without clinically important or progressive symptoms, so it has been observed.
Symptom Onset: 3 months
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia over 3 months
Characteristics: Vitreous hemorrhage due to breakthrough bleeding from choroidal neovascularization associated with macular degeneration; presents with progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia, reduced visual acuity (20/60 OD, 20/40 OS), vitreous blood obscuring view, diagnosed/assessed with B‑scan ultrasound and OCT showing VMT and hyperreflective posterior hyaloid partially attached to macula.


Subjective (cont.)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Vitreous hemorrhage due to breakthrough bleeding associated with choroidal neovascularization, OS.
Primary Diagnosis: Vitreous hemorrhage due to breakthrough bleeding from choroidal neovascularization (wet age-related macular degeneration), left eye (OS)
Differential Diagnosis: Spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage from choroidal neovascularization/breakthrough subretinal hemorrhage; Posterior vitreous detachment with retinal tear (± retinal detachment); Proliferative retinopathies (proliferative diabetic retinopathy, branch retinal vein occlusion, sickle retinopathy); Inflammatory vitreous opacities (pars planitis/uveitis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS


Plan
All Procedures: intravitreal ocriplasmin injection OD pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) OD
Follow-Up Instructions: Close follow-up with periodic clinical exam and B‑scan ultrasound as needed; observe for spontaneous clearing and reassess vision; consider vitrectomy if hemorrhage does not clear by 3–6 months (earlier if bilateral vision loss or other indications); counsel patient about visual prognosis and return promptly for any worsening (pain, increased floaters, flashes, or curtain).
Patient Education: Vitreous hemorrhage means blood has leaked into the gel of the eye, most often from abnormal new blood vessels or a retinal tear. Important points: - You may notice sudden floaters, haze, or decreased vision; activity that worsens vision may improve as blood settles. - Immediate evaluation is needed to rule out a retinal tear or detachment; B‑scan ultrasound is used when the view is blocked. - If caused by proliferative disease (eg, wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy) or a retinal tear, prompt treatment (laser, injection, or surgery) may prevent further vision loss. - Many small hemorrhages clear on their own over weeks to months; we will monitor vision and perform repeat exams/imaging. If bleeding does not clear or there is a retinal tear/detachment, vitrectomy (surgery to remove the blood) may be recommended. - There is no medication proven to speed clearing of the blood; positioning (slight head elevation) can let blood settle temporarily to improve examination. - Report new flashes, increased floaters, sudden worsening of vision, or curtain/shadow over vision immediately. - Keep follow‑up appointments and treat underlying causes (eg, anti‑VEGF injections or laser for AMD/diabetic disease) to reduce recurrence.


CASE 44 — Retinitis Pigmentosa
==============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden decreased vision in the left eye for 3 months
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 90-year-old woman with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye; prior vision 3 years earlier was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS from atrophic AMD OD and previously treated subfoveal CNV OS. Current VA at presentation 20/40 OD and 2/200 OS; left dense vitreous hemorrhage with 2+ nuclear sclerosis, B-scan showing vitreous hemorrhage with PVD OS, no retinal tear or detachment. Observed without treatment for 3 months, then VA improved to 20/400 with visible subfoveal laser scar and contiguous subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the midperiphery. No history of diabetes or hypertension.
History Narrative: This 90-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye. Her visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 2/200 OS. Intraocular pressures were 12 mm Hg in each eye. Slit-lamp examination showed a well-positioned posterior chamber lens implant on the right with vitreous adherent to the wound superiorly. In the left eye, she had 2+ nuclear sclerosis and a very dense vitreous hemorrhage precluding a view posteriorly. Past ocular history included vision of 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS three years earlier due to atrophic age-related macular degeneration OD and a previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane OS. Medical history was negative for diabetes or hypertension. B-scan/A-scan ultrasonography showed vitreous hemorrhage with posterior vitreous detachment OS without retinal tear or detachment, and a disciform scar could not be resolved in the left macula. She was observed without treatment for 3 months; on follow-up visual acuity improved to 20/400 and a subfoveal laser scar with contiguous subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the midperiphery was visible.
Symptom Onset: Between the second and fifth decades of life
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Moderately advanced, gradual progressive visual loss (variable rate)
Characteristics: Genetically heterogeneous inherited retinal degenerative disorder with progressive rod then cone photoreceptor dysfunction and death, presenting with nyctalopia, progressive peripheral vision loss, midperipheral retinal atrophy with vascular attenuation and pigmentary clumping (“bone spicules”), possible posterior subcapsular cataract and cystoid macular edema; most retain central vision until late stages; variable inheritance (sporadic, AR, AD, X‑linked).


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Exposure to damaging solar ultraviolet light
Associated Symptoms: Gradual progressive nyctalopia and progressive loss of peripheral vision

No family history noted. Recommend counseling, genetic testing discussion, low-vision aids as needed, monitoring for CME and cataract, consider vitamin supplementation and retinal implant options in end-stage disease.
Primary Diagnosis: Retinitis pigmentosa, sporadic, moderately advanced
Differential Diagnosis: Retinitis pigmentosa; Choroideremia; Gyrate atrophy; Vitamin A deficiency
Severity: Moderately advanced
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Progressive visual field loss leading to legal blindness (advanced stages) - Posterior subcapsular cataract (stellate PSC) - Cystoid macular edema (CME) - Retinal vascular attenuation and optic nerve atrophy - Posterior vitreous detachment and vitreous syneresis with vitreous hemorrhage - Pigmentary clumping (“bone spicules”)/retinal atrophy - Increased posterior capsule fibrosis after cataract surgery (requiring multiple YAG capsulotomies) - Potential for total visual loss in minority of patients


Plan
All Medications: Vitamin A palmitate 15,000 IU daily; Vitamin E (not recommended — may hasten progression); Lutein (oral); DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, oral); Acetazolamide (oral); Dorzolamide (topical, less effective for CME)
All Procedures: Observation (conservative management) for 3 months; B-scan/A-scan ultrasonography; slit-lamp examination; indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression (attempted); visual acuity testing; periodic follow-up examinations.
Follow-Up Instructions: If cataract or CME develops, consider treatment (cataract extraction may be challenging; anticipate possible multiple YAG posterior capsulotomies). Periodic yearly liver function tests may be helpful if placed on vitamin A therapy. Provide counseling regarding visual prognosis, genetic testing and low-vision rehabilitation; advise sunglasses to reduce solar UV exposure and routine follow-up for monitoring (eg, annual exams; more frequent if new symptoms).
Patient Education: Counseling regarding visual prognosis and hereditary risk to family members; advice on reducing retinal UV exposure with sunglasses; discussion of low-vision aids and rehabilitation options; inform about potential (but controversial) supplements (vitamin A, lutein, DHA) and risks/benefits and need for genetic testing to clarify inheritance and trial eligibility.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 26-year-old healthy Caucasian man with 1 week of bilateral decreased vision and scotomata following recent febrile illness and headaches. Examination: BCVA 20/30 OU, normal IOPs, no APD, quiet anterior segment and vitreous. Fundus: multiple flat, deep, creamy placoid lesions in the posterior poles OU. FA: early hypofluorescence with late staining corresponding to lesions; ICG: areas of decreased fluorescence. OCT: outer retinal hyperreflectivity, disruption of photoreceptor outer segments and RPE correlating with placoid lesions. Clinical presentation and multimodal imaging consistent with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome (acute posterior placoid-type choroiditis). Recommend prompt systemic corticosteroid therapy and close follow-up for inflammatory control and monitoring for complications.
Primary Diagnosis: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome
Differential Diagnosis: Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE); Serpiginous choroiditis; Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS); Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: posterior synechiae; angle-closure glaucoma; choroidal neovascularization; cataract formation; exudative retinal detachment


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% topical; oral prednisone (80–200 mg/day); ranitidine 150 mg twice daily; cycloplegic agent; intravenous steroids (for severe cases); cyclosporine; cyclophosphamide; chlorambucil; azathioprine
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow frequently in the initial stages to adjust corticosteroid treatment and monitor inflammation; once inflammation and exudative detachment decrease, lengthen intervals and taper systemic steroids slowly (over ~4–6 months, often up to 6 months) with careful observation for recurrence; if steroids inadequate or not tolerated, consider systemic immunosuppressants and refer for management; monitor regularly for cataract, choroidal neovascularization, and angle-closure glaucoma.
Patient Education: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome is an inflammatory condition affecting the back of the eye and sometimes other body systems. Prompt treatment with high‑dose oral corticosteroids (and in severe cases IV steroids) is important to reduce inflammation and preserve vision. You may also receive eyedrops (steroid drops and a cycloplegic) and stomach protection (H2 blocker) while on high‑dose steroids. Expect frequent follow‑up initially to monitor response and adjust therapy; steroids are tapered very slowly over months to reduce relapse risk. If steroids are ineffective or cause intolerable side effects, other immunosuppressive medications may be used. Report new symptoms such as worsening vision, eye pain, severe headache, hearing changes, dizziness, or skin/hair changes promptly. Long‑term monitoring is needed for complications like cataract, glaucoma, or choroidal neovascularization.
Work Restrictions: Avoid heavy physical exertion and activities risking head/eye trauma while on high-dose systemic corticosteroids; may require frequent follow-up visits and possible time off work during acute treatment and taper (activity modification as tolerated).

=================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: multiple black spots in the visual field of both eyes for 2 weeks
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "new onset of multiple black spots in the visual field of the right and left eyes for 2 weeks"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 32-year-old woman with a 10-year history of AIDS (on HAART) and CD4 count 64 presenting with 2 weeks of new onset multiple black spots (floaters) in both visual fields. She reported no anterior segment symptoms; vision decreased to 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS.
History Narrative: A 32-year-old woman with a 10-year history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and a CD4 count of 64 presented with a 2-week history of new onset multiple black spots in the visual fields of both eyes. She reported no significant anterior segment symptoms; systemic history notable for long-standing HIV/AIDS managed with HAART.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Characteristics: Multiple deep, creamy‑yellow/white placoid lesions at the level of the outer retina/RPE (often bilateral), early hypofluorescence on FA with late staining, minimal anterior/vitreous inflammation, disruption of outer photoreceptor segments on OCT, usually self‑limited with good visual prognosis.


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: No known alleviating factors/N/A
Associated Symptoms: new onset of multiple black spots in the visual field (floaters)
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — visual symptoms (scotomas, decreased central vision, photopsias) likely interfere with reading, driving, and detailed work but many conditions are self-limited or partially recover with treatment.
Systemic Symptoms: viral prodrome, headaches
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: Individuals with recent viral prodrome or upper respiratory infection (e.g., recent fevers, headache)
Risk Factors: - Recent viral prodrome/upper respiratory infection - Young age (20–40s for many syndromes) - Female sex (especially myopic females for MEWDS, MCP, PIC) - Myopia (MEWDS, MCP, PIC) - Caucasian ethnicity (APMPPE, SC, BSCR) - HLA-A29 positivity (birdshot chorioretinopathy) - Immunosuppression/low CD4 count (risk for infectious retinitis like CMV)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 32-year-old woman with AIDS (CD4 64) on HAART presenting with 2 weeks of new black spots bilaterally. Examination notable for BCVA 20/30 OD, 20/40 OS; IOP 10 mm Hg OU; quiet anterior segments. Fundus OD: confluent creamy yellow-white hemorrhagic retinitis with prominent associated hemorrhage extending from superior disc into midperiphery, active vitritis and vascular sheathing along superotemporal arcade. OS: peripheral temporal retinitis without hemorrhage. Findings most consistent with bilateral CMV retinitis (classic hemorrhagic, necrotizing retinitis tracking along arcades) in the setting of advanced immunosuppression. Differential includes acute retinal necrosis and toxoplasmosis, but lack of marked anterior inflammation and hemorrhagic pattern favor CMV. Recommend prompt systemic antiviral therapy and ophthalmic management with frequent funduscopic monitoring; consider intravitreal antivirals and coordination with infectious disease for systemic CMV treatment and evaluation of immune status.
Primary Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis
Differential Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis; Acute retinal necrosis (herpes viruses); Ocular toxoplasmosis; Syphilitic retinitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: CNVM; CME; ERM; RPE atrophy and scarring; optic neuropathy; retinal detachment; neovascular glaucoma


Plan
All Medications: highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) oral corticosteroids periocular steroids systemic steroids immunosuppression / immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine) antituberculosis therapy intravitreal steroids anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
All Procedures: funduscopic examination; indirect ophthalmoscopy; fluorescein angiography (FA); optical coherence tomography (OCT); indocyanine green angiography (ICG); fundus photography; fundus autofluorescence (FAF); electroretinogram (ERG); Goldmann visual field testing; Humphrey visual field testing; Amsler grid testing; periocular steroid injection; intravitreal steroid injection; anti-VEGF intravitreal injection; laser photocoagulation; systemic corticosteroid therapy (oral corticosteroids); immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) / immunosuppression; HLA-A29 testing; neuroimaging; laboratory evaluation for tuberculosis and syphilis; ophthalmoscopic screening every 3–6 months
Patient Education: These white‑dot syndromes are inflammatory conditions of the retina/choroid that often follow a viral illness, can cause floaters, photopsias, scotomas or decreased vision, and are diagnosed mainly with eye imaging (FA, ICG, OCT). Many are self‑limited (e.g., MEWDS, APMPPE, ARPE) and often improve without treatment; others (e.g., serpiginous choroiditis, birdshot, multifocal choroiditis) can be chronic and may require long‑term immunosuppression to prevent vision loss. Prompt evaluation for systemic causes (e.g., tuberculosis, syphilis) or neurologic symptoms is important. Follow prescribed imaging and follow‑up schedule; report new visual changes immediately. If on immunosuppression or for HIV patients, maintain systemic therapy and routine screening (e.g., ophthalmic exams every 3–6 months if CD4 <100).


CASE 48 — Vascular Tumor
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: photopsias and blurred central vision in the right eye for 3 days
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "photopsias and blurred central vision in the right eye for the previous 3 days"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old Caucasian man with a 2-week history of photopsias and 3 days of blurred central vision in the right eye.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 2-week history of photopsias and blurred central vision in the right eye for the previous 3 days. Past medical history was notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and skin cancer. Past ocular history was remarkable for macular degeneration. Examination disclosed a visual acuity of 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg in both eyes. There was a 1+ right afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination was notable for mild nuclear sclerotic alterations in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a dome-shaped moderately pigmented inferotemporal mass with an exudative retinal detachment located anterior to the mass. Examination of the left eye was unremarkable. The lesion had a thickness of 4.5 mm and base of 11.9 × 10.1 mm confirmed by echography. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated a dome-shaped lesion with an exudative retinal detachment and choroidal excavation. There was no evidence of extrascleral extension. A-scan ultrasonography revealed low internal reflectivity and a regular internal structure. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye demonstrated a lesion with intrinsic vascularity and progressive late leakage. The patient underwent a medical workup to rule out the presence of metastasis, including liver function tests and a chest X-ray that was unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with a medium-sized posterior uveal melanoma. After discussion of alternative treatment options, the patient underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy for gene-expression profiling at the time of iodine-125 radioactive plaque placement. Gene profiling yielded a class 1A tumor, prompting annual liver ultrasound for metastatic evaluation. Seven months following radioactive plaque therapy, visual acuity in the right eye was 20/40 and there was progressive nuclear sclerosis of the lens. The mass had decreased in size posttreatment to a height of 2.3 mm. There were significant pigmentary alterations of the lesion with resolution of the overlying neurosensory detachment. The remainder of the retina remained normal, without radiation-related changes.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Progression: Decreased in size (height reduced from 4.5 mm to 2.3 mm) with resolution of overlying neurosensory detachment and progressive nuclear sclerosis of the lens.
Characteristics: Dome-shaped, moderately pigmented inferotemporal choroidal mass with intrinsic vascularity, low internal reflectivity on A-scan, regular internal structure, choroidal excavation, associated exudative (anterior) retinal detachment, decreased in size after plaque radiotherapy with pigmentary alterations.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: Photopsias and blurred central vision
Prior Treatments: Iodine-125 radioactive plaque therapy with concurrent fine-needle aspiration biopsy for gene-expression profiling

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 1. Right eye: Posterior uveal (choroidal) melanoma, medium-sized (initial thickness 4.5 mm, basal dimensions ~11.9 × 10.1 mm) with exudative retinal detachment and intrinsic vascularity on angiography. A- and B-scan ultrasound consistent with dome-shaped lesion, low internal reflectivity, choroidal excavation, no extrascleral extension. Fine-needle aspiration performed for gene-expression profiling which returned Class 1A (low metastatic potential). Systemic metastatic workup (LFTs, chest X-ray) unremarkable. 2. Post-treatment status (7 months after I-125 plaque radiotherapy): Tumor regression to 2.3 mm thickness with resolution of overlying neurosensory detachment, pigmentary changes at lesion site, visual acuity improved to 20/40 OD, progressive nuclear sclerosis of the lens; no radiation-related retinal vasculopathy observed. 3. Left eye: Unremarkable; visual acuity 20/20 OS, IOPs 15 mm Hg OU. Plan: Continue surveillance for local control and radiation-induced changes; annual systemic metastatic screening (liver ultrasound) given Class 1A result per institutional protocol; monitor cataract progression and visual function; routine ophthalmic follow-up with periodic imaging (B-scan/OCT/fundus photography) and systemic surveillance as indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Choroidal melanoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Hypercholesterolemia; Skin cancer; Macular degeneration
Differential Diagnosis: Choroidal melanoma; Choroidal hemangioma; Metastatic choroidal tumor
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Exudative retinal detachment - Progressive nuclear sclerosis (cataract) - Vision loss/reduced visual acuity - Radiation-related changes (potential, though not observed)


Plan
All Medications: iodine-125 radioactive plaque (radiation therapy)
All Procedures: fine-needle aspiration biopsy for gene-expression profiling; iodine-125 radioactive plaque placement (plaque radiotherapy)
Follow-Up Instructions: Annual to biannual ophthalmic examination for affected individuals and first‑degree relatives; periodic systemic screening with CNS and thoracic/abdominal imaging and 24‑hour urine collection for pheochromocytoma.
Patient Education: Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited condition that can cause tumors in the eye and other organs. Because retinal angiomas (tumors of the retina) are often an early sign, it is important to have regular eye exams and systemic screening. You should: - Have periodic ophthalmic exams (indirect ophthalmoscopy) — typically annually to every six months — and ensure first-degree relatives are examined as well. - Undergo genetic counseling and consider genetic testing for VHL, especially if there is a family history or multiple findings. - Receive systemic screening for VHL-associated tumors: imaging of the brain/spine (CNS), chest and abdomen (to evaluate kidneys, pancreas, adrenal glands), and 24-hour urine testing for pheochromocytoma. - Report new symptoms promptly (vision changes, headaches, back pain, high blood pressure, palpitations, abdominal pain). - Coordinate care with a multidisciplinary team (ophthalmology, genetics, neurosurgery, oncology/urology/endocrinology) for surveillance and treatment planning. - Understand treatment options for retinal angiomas: observation for small, stable lesions; laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy for vision‑threatening lesions; possible plaque radiotherapy or external beam radiotherapy for large lesions; and that intravitreal or systemic anti‑VEGF therapies are investigational. - Know that treatment responses can take months and complications (increased exudation, vitreoretinal traction) may occur; surgery may be needed for complications but is often delayed 4–6 months to allow spontaneous improvement. - Maintain regular follow-up and imaging as recommended by your care team to monitor for tumor progression and systemic involvement.

============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Peripheral retinal lesion in left eye found on routine ophthalmic examination
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 49-year-old man asymptomatic found on routine ophthalmic examination to have a peripheral retinal lesion in the left eye; no ocular symptoms, no past ocular history, no systemic medical problems; family history notable for father and two siblings with von Hippel–Lindau disease; visual acuity 20/20 bilaterally.
History Narrative: A 20-year-old man presented for evaluation of a peripheral retinal lesion in the left eye found on routine ophthalmic examination. He was asymptomatic with no past ocular history and no known systemic medical problems. Family history was notable for von Hippel–Lindau disease in his father and two siblings. Visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. External exam, pupils (no afferent pupillary defect), visual fields, and motility were unremarkable. Slit-lamp exam was normal. Fundus examination of the left eye showed several dilated, tortuous arterioles and venules emanating from the optic disc and traveling nasally, leading to a collection of reddish‑pink nodules surrounding a large reddish‑orange lesion on the retinal surface with a small area of associated subretinal fluid and adjacent exudate. The right eye fundus was normal.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: medium-sized choroidal melanoma.
Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: medium-sized choroidal melanoma
Differential Diagnosis: choroidal nevus; congenital hypertrophy of the RPE (CHRPE); metastatic carcinoma to the choroid; choroidal hemangioma
Severity: Medium
Laterality: Right
Complications: radiation-related complications including retinopathy, optic neuropathy, and cataract; radiation-vasculopathy and optic neuropathy (occur at ~30–50% at 5 years, increased for tumors adjacent to optic nerve or fovea)


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up every 3 months during the first year, then every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly thereafter; perform clinical exam, fundus photography, and ultrasonography at each visit (use autofluorescence and OCT as indicated); note that ultrasound may show transient post‑treatment height increase in first 6 months; for systemic surveillance use gene‑expression–based risk stratification: class 1A — annual liver imaging; class 1B — annual liver imaging + liver enzymes staggered by 6 months; class 2 — liver imaging and liver enzymes every 6 months staggered by 3 months.
Patient Education: Choroidal melanoma is a cancer in the layer beneath the retina (choroid). It can threaten vision and can spread to other organs (most commonly the liver), so close follow-up and systemic monitoring are important. Treatment depends on size and location and may include plaque brachytherapy (radiation to save the eye), enucleation (removal of the eye) for very large tumors or poor visual prognosis, or less commonly local resection or charged-particle therapy. Before treatment you may need imaging (eye ultrasonography, OCT, fundus photos) and systemic staging (liver imaging, possibly blood tests). After radiation, expect regular follow-up exams with imaging every 3 months the first year, then extending to 6 months and yearly thereafter to monitor tumor regression, detect recurrence, and watch for complications (radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy, cataract). If tumor is genotyped, follow-up for metastasis is risk-based: low-risk (annual liver imaging), intermediate-risk (annual liver imaging + staggered liver enzymes), high-risk (liver imaging and liver enzymes every 6 months staggered by 3 months). Report new visual changes, eye pain, or systemic symptoms (abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue) promptly. Discuss fertility, work, driving, and prosthetic/rehabilitation resources if enucleation is needed; referral to ocular oncology and medical oncology for systemic surveillance is recommended.

=======================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: acute-onset severe pain and loss of vision in the left eye
DURATION: 4 days
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 78-year-old woman presented 4 days after a complicated left cataract surgery with acute-onset severe pain and loss of vision in the left eye; vision was hand motion OS, IOP 39 mm Hg OS, left eye had conjunctival injection, shallow anterior chamber, aphakia, temporal clear corneal incision with interrupted nylon sutures, and a bullous appositional retinal detachment posterior to the iris; past ocular history notable for high myopia (−9.00), primary open-angle glaucoma, and she was on timolol, dorzolamide, and prednisolone acetate OD/OS.
History Narrative: A 78-year-old woman with myopia (−9.00 D) and primary open-angle glaucoma presented 4 days after a complicated left cataract surgery with acute-onset severe pain and loss of vision in the left eye. Past medical history included coronary artery bypass grafting 2 years earlier and systemic hypertension. Medications included topical timolol 0.5% OU twice daily, dorzolamide 2% OU three times daily, and prednisolone acetate 1% OS four times daily. On presentation visual acuity was 20/60 OD and hand motion OS; IOP was 12 mm Hg OD and 39 mm Hg OS. Left eye exam showed 2+ conjunctival injection, a temporal clear corneal incision closed with interrupted nylon sutures, a shallow anterior chamber, aphakia, and a bullous appositional retinal detachment posterior to the iris. B-scan ultrasound demonstrated appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhages with clotted suprachoroidal blood. The elevated left IOP was managed medically; observation with serial echography was initially recommended. Eight days later liquefaction of the suprachoroidal blood was seen and the patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of the suprachoroidal hemorrhage and fluid–gas exchange; no draining retinotomy was performed because no retinal breaks were identified. At three months follow-up left eye vision was 20/400.

CASE 51 — Cystoid Macular Edema
===============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after cataract surgery
DURATION: 6 years
LATERALITY: OD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 64-year-old woman presented with sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL insertion; intraoperatively a central posterior capsular rupture occurred and the IOL was placed in the ciliary sulcus, and postoperatively she had 2+ microbullous corneal edema superiorly, moderate anterior chamber cells, vitreous incarceration in the wound, and a freely mobile PCIOL in the vitreous cavity inferiorly.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman presented with sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL insertion. During the procedure a central posterior capsular rupture occurred and the IOL was placed anterior to the remaining anterior capsule into the ciliary sulcus. Postoperatively her left eye vision was 20/30 with an aphakic correction. Slit-lamp exam showed 2+ microbullous corneal edema superiorly and moderate anterior chamber cells; the pupil was round but there was vitreous incarceration in the wound. Residual capsule was not noted. Fundus exam disclosed a freely mobile PCIOL within the vitreous cavity inferiorly with attached retina. Surgery was recommended and performed to reposition the dislocated PCIOL into the ciliary sulcus using scleral suturing of the haptics under two partial-thickness superotemporal and inferonasal scleral flaps to cover knots. One month postoperatively the IOL was well positioned with vision 20/60, which returned to 20/20 within 6 months and remained 20/20 at 6 years; the IOL stayed centered with no complications. The right eye vision was 20/400 from nuclear sclerosis.
Symptom Onset: 2 days after surgery
Symptom Duration: 2 days
Progression: Resolved
Characteristics: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema (Irvine–Gass syndrome)


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Iris trauma, vitreous prolapse/incarceration, retained lens fragments, vitreomacular traction, inflammation from complicated cataract surgery (e.g., posterior capsular rupture)
Alleviating Factors: Resolution often occurs spontaneously within 3–4 months; topical NSAIDs and corticosteroids (and combination therapy) can improve CME; periocular or intravitreal steroid injections and pars plana vitrectomy may alleviate refractory cases.
Associated Symptoms: sudden decreased vision in the left eye, glare, monocular diplopia, pain
Previous Episodes: Yes — this was a new, postoperative CME; no prior episodes reported.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema of the right eye (OD) following complicated cataract extraction with posterior capsular rupture and vitreous incarceration; exam and imaging demonstrate macular thickening with cystic changes consistent with CME. Initial management with topical NSAIDs and corticosteroids recommended, with consideration of periocular or intravitreal steroid or vitrectomy if refractory or if vitreomacular traction/retained lens material present. Follow-up in 4–6 weeks to assess response.
Primary Diagnosis: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema, OD
Differential Diagnosis: Pseudophakic (Irvine–Gass) cystoid macular edema; Vitreomacular traction–related macular edema; Inflammatory/postoperative uveitic macular edema
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: Cystoid macular edema; vitreous incarceration in the wound; posterior capsular rupture; dislocated posterior chamber IOL into the vitreous (IOL dislocation); corneal microbullous edema; anterior chamber inflammation (cells)


Plan
All Medications: flurbiprofen (topical), suprofen (topical), ketorolac 0.5% (topical), prednisolone 1% (topical), periocular corticosteroid injection, intravitreal corticosteroid injection, ranibizumab (intravitreal anti-VEGF), bevacizumab (intravitreal anti-VEGF), aflibercept (intravitreal anti-VEGF)
All Procedures: extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) insertion; repositioning of dislocated PCIOL with scleral suturing fixation through partial‑thickness scleral flaps (pars plana approach indicated as preferred)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe within 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical treatment; follow carefully even after improvement due to risk of recurrence.
Patient Education: Cystoid macular edema (CME) is swelling in the central retina that can occur after cataract surgery and may cause blurred vision. It is usually diagnosed by eye exam and OCT (retinal imaging). Most cases improve on their own over 3–4 months, but treatment often speeds recovery and prevents lasting vision loss. First-line therapy is topical anti-inflammatory eye drops (a steroid plus a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) used frequently for several weeks. If topical treatment fails, injections around or into the eye (steroids) or vitrectomy surgery may be recommended, especially if vitreous is pulling on the macula or there are retained lens fragments. You will need follow-up at about 4–6 weeks to check for improvement; some patients need longer treatment or repeat therapy. Report any worsening vision, new floaters, pain, or increasing redness promptly.

Primary Diagnosis: Acute infectious postoperative endophthalmitis, left eye
Differential Diagnosis: Infectious endophthalmitis (acute postoperative); Toxic anterior segment syndrome; Retained lens material–induced inflammation; Exacerbation of preexisting uveitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: right
Complications: Endophthalmitis


Plan
All Medications: vancomycin; ceftazidime; corticosteroids (dexamethasone); amikacin; fourth-generation fluoroquinolones; topical vancomycin; aminoglycoside; povidone-iodine; aflibercept; triamcinolone; systemic antibiotics; systemic antifungals
All Procedures: vitreous tap and intravitreal injection of antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime or amikacin) pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with partial or total capsulectomy and possible IOL exchange/removal intravitreal injection of corticosteroid (dexamethasone) adjunctively vitreous sampling for cultures and smears (vitreous biopsy) B-scan ultrasonography use of povidone-iodine and sterile lid speculum for intravitreal injections
Follow-Up Instructions: Prompt intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin + ceftazidime or amikacin) after vitreous tap, consider dexamethasone, obtain vitreous cultures and smears, perform B‑scan ultrasound as needed, follow clinically with close monitoring for worsening vision or signs requiring pars plana vitrectomy (especially if light‑perception vision), involve infectious disease for endogenous cases, and arrange urgent surgical PPV with capsulectomy/IOL removal for chronic/atypical cases.
Patient Education: You have an infection inside the eye called endophthalmitis, which can occur after surgery, injections, trauma, or from spread through the bloodstream. It can progress quickly and threaten vision, so prompt treatment is essential. What caused it and what to expect - It most commonly follows cataract surgery or intravitreal injections but can be from other sources. - Symptoms often include decreased vision, eye pain, redness, and sometimes pus or a hypopyon. Some forms (late/chronic or fungal) may be less painful but more indolent. - Rapid treatment improves the chance of preserving vision; prognosis depends on the organism and how soon treatment starts. Treatments you may receive - Immediate sampling of eye fluid (tap) and injection of broad‑spectrum intravitreal antibiotics (commonly vancomycin plus ceftazidime or amikacin). - For severe vision loss (light perception only) or aggressive infections, pars plana vitrectomy (surgical removal of infected vitreous) is often recommended. - Additional treatments may include topical antibiotics/steroids, systemic antibiotics or antifungals for endogenous infections, and possible removal of lens/capsule in chronic cases. - Cultures guide further therapy once results are available. Home care and follow‑up - Expect close follow‑up in the first 24–72 hours with frequent exams; adhere strictly to all medications and appointments. - Report any worsening pain, vision loss, increased redness, or discharge immediately (emergency). - Avoid touching or rubbing the eye, and keep the eye clean and protected per instructions (shield, no swimming). Prevention and risk reduction - For future procedures, measures that reduce infection risk include povidone‑iodine prep and sterile technique; routine topical antibiotic prophylaxis has not been shown to clearly reduce risk. - Control systemic risk factors (e.g., diabetes) and inform providers of any infections or immune suppression. If you have questions or new symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist or go to the emergency department immediately.

CASE 54 — Ruptured Globe
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision in the left eye after metal-on-metal impact (suspected intraocular foreign body)
DURATION: 25 years
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 32‑year‑old man struck a metal banister with a metal hammer while repairing it aboard a docked research ship; he felt minor left eye pain at the time and over the next 2 hours noted a subtle but definite decrease in vision, presenting with 20/30 vision.
History Narrative: A 32-year-old man was working aboard a docked marine biology research ship repairing a metal banister. While striking the metal rail with a metal hammer, he experienced a minor pain in his left eye. Over the ensuing 2 hours, he noticed a subtle but definite decrease in vision. On presentation, his visual acuity was 20/30. Slit-lamp examination showed a deep anterior chamber with minimal cell and flare. There was a defect in the temporal iris approximately 1 mm from the limbus. Corresponding to this site was a slitlike corneal defect that was not leaking aqueous fluid by Seidel testing. Posterior to the iris, there was a sectoral, white opacity in the peripheral lens. Examination of the posterior pole disclosed a small intraocular foreign body embedded in the retinal midperiphery with a collar of retinal edema surrounding it but no hemorrhage.
Symptom Onset: 2 hours
Symptom Duration: 2 hours
Progression: Resolved/stable (vision recovered to 20/20 and maintained for 25 years)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Ruptured globe, left eye (OS) with retained metallic intraocular foreign body involving temporal peripheral cornea, iris, lens and embedded in midperipheral retina with surrounding retinal edema. Vision at presentation 20/30; no afferent pupillary defect. Managed with primary operative intervention: pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy, intraocular lens implantation, magnetic extraction of IOFB, low encircling scleral buckle, and endolaser around retinal defect. Intraoperative induction of posterior vitreous detachment; mild retinal bleeding at removal site controlled. Postoperative course stable with attached retina and final best-corrected visual acuity 20/20 maintained through 25 years. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics and tetanus as indicated; protective measures and long-term follow-up recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Ruptured globe, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Intraocular foreign body; Traumatic cataract (lens opacity/rupture)
Differential Diagnosis: Intraocular foreign body (penetrating globe injury); Ruptured globe with corneoscleral laceration; Occult scleral rupture with vitreous prolapse; Traumatic endophthalmitis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS
Complications: Intraocular foreign body; lens injury (traumatic cataract/need for lensectomy); retinal impact with localized edema and mild bleeding; risk of endophthalmitis; vitreous hemorrhage; potential retinal detachment; proliferative vitreoretinopathy/fibrous proliferation; possible scleral rupture/dehiscence; aphakia (temporary) and need for IOL implantation; long-term irregular astigmatism.


Plan
All Procedures: vitrectomy with lensectomy and intraocular lens implantation; magnetic extraction of intraocular foreign body; low encircling scleral buckle; laser photocoagulation surrounding retinal defect; induction of posterior vitreous detachment with vitrectomy instrument; primary closure of corneoscleral laceration (corneal 10–0 nylon and scleral nylon/polyglactin sutures)
Follow-Up Instructions: As long as anatomic and visual stabilization is observed, lengthen follow-up intervals; cicatricial response is usually complete by 6 weeks post‑op. Consider additional surgery (epiretinal membrane removal or IOL implantation) at ~3 months for visual rehabilitation if indicated. Recommend shatter-proof safety glasses for the fellow eye and arrange vocational rehabilitation as needed.
Patient Education: Shatter-proof safety glasses are strongly recommended to protect the fellow eye and prevent similar injuries; discuss need for tetanus booster if not up to date; explain the signs of infection (increasing pain, redness, discharge, decreasing vision) and to seek urgent care if present; emphasize postoperative activity restrictions and follow-up schedule, and that further surgeries (IOL implantation, membrane peeling) or visual rehabilitation (rigid contact lens, vocational support) may be needed.
Emergency Instructions: Place a protective shield over the eye to protect it from further trauma and pressure; administer parenteral broad‑spectrum antibiotics; check tetanus status and give booster if not within 5 years; arrange urgent ophthalmic surgical evaluation for globe repair/IOFB management.


CASE 55 — Intraocular Foreign Body
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor vision (noticed upon waking the morning after a fall)
DURATION: 3 years
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 80-year-old woman who presented the morning after a fall at her nursing home with periocular ecchymoses after presumed direct ocular trauma on a piece of furniture; initially no pain or visual loss but upon waking the next morning noted poor vision. Prior cataract surgery 3 years earlier; pre-injury vision 20/30 limited by atrophic macular degeneration. On presentation OS vision hand motions, IOP 10 mm Hg, cornea relatively clear, formed AC, conjunctival chemosis temporally/superiorly, scleral dehiscence at prior cataract wound with posterior chamber IOL seen subconjunctivally, dense vitreous hemorrhage limiting posterior view.
History Narrative: An 80-year-old woman presented the morning after falling at her nursing home. Although the exact history was unclear, periocular ecchymoses suggested direct ocular trauma on a piece of furniture. Initially, the patient had not noticed pain or visual loss, but upon waking the next morning she realized poor vision and sought consultation. Cataract surgery with a nuclear expression extracapsular technique had been performed 3 years previously. Before the injury, the vision had been documented as 20/30, limited by some atrophic macular degeneration changes. Upon presentation, visual acuity was hand motions and the intraocular pressure was 10 mm Hg. The cornea appeared relatively clear with a formed anterior chamber. However, there was conjunctival chemosis temporally and superiorly. While raising the upper lid, there was no conjunctival laceration, but a scleral dehiscence was evident, apparently at the previous cataract wound; upon examination of the superotemporal quadrant, the posterior chamber implant was seen in the subconjunctival space. The view posteriorly was limited by a dense vitreous hemorrhage. The pupil was not peaked, and there was no vitreous anterior to the iris.
Symptom Onset: 1 day ago
Symptom Duration: <24 hours
Progression: Improved (from hand motions to 20/100 at 3 months)
Characteristics: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body, posterior-segment involvement with vitreous hemorrhage and scleral dehiscence at prior cataract wound, associated subretinal hemorrhage (superotemporal midperiphery) and subsequent minimal epiretinal membrane; aphakic after IOL removal.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Nursing home fall onto furniture causing direct ocular trauma; prior extracapsular cataract wound (scleral dehiscence) with posterior chamber IOL extrusion; dense vitreous hemorrhage and subretinal hemorrhage; retained magnetic metallic intraocular foreign body; delayed presentation (found next morning).
Associated Symptoms: poor vision; no pain
Prior Treatments: Cataract surgery with a nuclear expression extracapsular technique 3 years prior
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — persistent visual impairment (20/100 OS, aphakic) limiting activities requiring good vision, but retina attached and stable allowing some independence.
Recent Travel: No recent travel
Risk Factors: Industrial trauma (metal-to-metal impact), lack of protective eyewear, workplace injuries (e.g., farm/field-related), periorbital/furniture-related blunt trauma, prior ocular surgery (cataract wound dehiscence)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 80-year-old woman with globe penetration at prior cataract wound after fall, presenting next morning with hand motion vision OS, IOP 10 mmHg, formed anterior chamber, conjunctival chemosis and scleral dehiscence superotemporally with subconjunctival posterior chamber IOL, dense vitreous hemorrhage limiting posterior view, no pupil peaking, no anterior vitreous. Intraoperative findings: vitreous incarcerated at wound, no retinal detachment but focal superotemporal midperipheral subretinal hemorrhage. Underwent same-day pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy/IOL removal and placement of encircling scleral band. Postop: attached posterior pole, minimal epiretinal membrane, organized subretinal hemorrhage at buckle base with self-limited traction, aphakic corrected VA 20/100 at 3 months. Diagnosis: retained magnetic intraocular foreign body OS with traumatic open-globe wound at prior cataract incision, surgically repaired with vitrectomy and scleral buckle; monitored for infection and retinal complications.
Primary Diagnosis: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Intraocular foreign body (retained magnetic), aphakia, vitreous hemorrhage, subretinal hemorrhage, epiretinal membrane, scleral dehiscence, conjunctival chemosis, periocular ecchymoses
Differential Diagnosis: Retained intraocular foreign body (metallic vs nonmetallic); Globe rupture/perforating ocular trauma with wound dehiscence; Traumatic lens/implant dislocation with vitreous hemorrhage; Endophthalmitis (post-traumatic)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS
Complications: retained intraocular foreign body; vitreous hemorrhage; scleral dehiscence/wound dehiscence with IOL extrusion (subconjunctival IOL); subretinal hemorrhage; epiretinal membrane; decreased visual acuity (20/100 aphakic); risk of endophthalmitis


Plan
All Medications: prophylactic systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics (initial systemic antibiotics; may include agents covering Bacillus cereus for farm/field injuries); intravitreal antibiotics (in especially suspicious cases); topical corticosteroids; topical antibiotics; topical cycloplegic agents; intravenous antibiotics (postoperative)
All Procedures: vitrectomy; placement of an encircling scleral band (scleral buckle); removal of intraocular lens (IOL) (lensectomy/explanted IOL)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observed at approximately 1- to 2-week intervals in the first month postoperatively, then less frequently thereafter; monitor for signs of endophthalmitis, recurrent retinal detachment, and visually significant epiretinal membrane; if no endophthalmitis and good progress after 24–48 hours, discontinue systemic antibiotics; consider later secondary IOL implantation or aphakic contact lens if aphakic.
Patient Education: An intraocular foreign body (IOFB) is a piece of material that has entered the eye, commonly from trauma. Because metallic IOFBs can damage eye tissues and carry a high risk of infection, prompt evaluation and usually surgical removal are important. Do not undergo MRI until a metallic IOFB has been ruled out. You will likely need imaging (X‑ray or CT) and an urgent ophthalmic surgery (vitrectomy/lensectomy and IOFB removal) to repair the eye and lower infection risk. Broad‑spectrum antibiotics are typically started to prevent endophthalmitis; sometimes intravitreal antibiotics are given. After surgery you will receive topical steroids, antibiotics, and possibly cycloplegic drops, plus short‑term systemic antibiotics if indicated. Follow‑up visits are frequent initially (1–2 weeks) to watch for infection, retinal detachment, or membranes that can affect vision. If left aphakic you may later discuss lens replacement or an aphakic contact lens. Seek immediate care for worsening pain, redness, discharge, sudden vision loss, new floaters, or flashes.
Emergency Instructions: Avoid MRI until metallic IOFB is excluded; treat as open-globe trauma—shield the eye, avoid pressure on globe, give IV broad‑spectrum antibiotics promptly, arrange urgent ophthalmic surgical evaluation for removal (ideally within 6–12 hours).


CASE 56 — Optic Neuritis
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden vision loss in a young patient with eye pain on movement and anisocoria
DURATION: several months
LATERALITY: Unspecified
PATIENT QUOTES: "blurry"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 24-year-old student nurse referred for headaches and anisocoria. Headaches present for several years, worse over past few months, daily, diffuse, not associated with nausea or vomiting. She reports always “blurry” vision, especially with headaches. Denies diplopia or other eye problems. Takes medications only for headaches. Referred after neurologist noted anisocoria. Onset insidious/chronic with recent worsening.
History Narrative: A 24-year-old student nurse was referred for headaches and anisocoria. She had daily, diffuse headaches for several years that worsened over the past few months and were not associated with nausea or vomiting. She reported always having “blurry” vision, especially with her headaches, denied diplopia or other eye problems, and took only medications for her headaches. A neurologist had noted anisocoria and referred her for ophthalmologic evaluation. Examination showed best-corrected visual acuity 20/20 OU, full visual fields, and color vision 10/10 Hardy–Rand–Rittler plates OU. Pupils measured 8 mm OD and 4 mm OS; the right pupil did not react to light or near, while the left pupil reacted briskly to light and near. No relative afferent pupillary defect was documented. Ocular motility was normal without ptosis. Slit-lamp exam revealed both pupils smoothly round without irregularities and no segmental contraction of the right pupil to light. Fundus exam was normal without disc swelling. Past medical history notable only for headaches; no facial sensory or motor deficits.
Symptom Onset: Several years (worse over the last few months)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 24-year-old woman with acute unilateral visual complaints consistent with typical demyelinating optic neuritis. Exam findings supporting optic neuritis include periocular pain with eye movement, decreased vision acuity and/or visual field defect and an afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in asymmetric disease; optic nerve head often normal. MRI recommended to evaluate for demyelinating lesions and guide management. Given age and presentation, treat per ONTT protocol with IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone taper if MRI abnormal or rapid recovery desired; avoid standard-dose oral prednisone alone. Consider testing for NMO and MOG antibodies if atypical features, bilateral involvement, poor recovery, or MRI non-diagnostic. Follow-up for visual recovery over weeks to months and monitor risk of MS if MRI shows demyelinating lesions.
Primary Diagnosis: Optic neuritis
Secondary Diagnoses: Anisocoria (pharmacologic mydriasis)
Differential Diagnosis: Pharmacologic mydriasis; Tonic (Adie) pupil; Third cranial nerve palsy (pupil-involving); Optic neuritis (retrobulbar)
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Development of multiple sclerosis (increased risk, especially with abnormal MRI) - Persistent visual loss or incomplete visual recovery (worse prognosis with poor initial acuity or NMO) - Recurrent optic neuritis (including steroid-dependent or steroid-sensitive relapses) - Conversion to neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or association with MOG-antibody disease - Increased risk of new attacks of optic neuritis with standard-dose oral prednisone


Plan
All Medications: headache medications (unspecified) IV methylprednisolone sodium succinate oral prednisone high‑dose oral methylprednisolone (e.g., 500 mg) oral placebo
All Procedures: MRI of the orbits/brain (magnetic resonance imaging)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up for visual recovery; expect most improvement by 30 days with continued gradual improvement up to 1 year if incomplete at 30 days; evaluate for NMO or other etiologies if poor recovery or atypical features; consider MRI for demyelinating lesions and arrange NMO/MOG antibody testing as indicated; monitor for development of MS and follow neurologic care as needed.
Patient Education: Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve that often causes sudden, usually one-sided vision loss, pain with eye movement, and changes in color vision. Most cases occur in young adults and many improve substantially over weeks to months. Standard evaluation includes an MRI of the brain and orbits to look for demyelinating lesions (risk for multiple sclerosis) and to rule out other causes; additional testing (e.g., NMO or MOG antibody tests) may be needed in atypical or bilateral cases. Treatment options: high‑dose IV corticosteroids followed by an oral steroid taper can speed recovery and may reduce short‑term MS risk in patients with abnormal MRI; standard‑dose oral prednisone alone should be avoided. If vision does not improve or worsens, or if you develop new neurologic symptoms, seek prompt care. Follow-up: close ophthalmology and neurology follow‑up with repeat visual testing and MRI as recommended; most patients recover substantially by 1 month but improvement can continue for up to a year. Contact your clinician promptly for sudden worsening, severe pain, or new symptoms (weakness, numbness, bladder/bowel changes).
Referrals: Neurologist (for headaches/anisocoria)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 57 Optic Disc Edema with Macular Star (Neuroretinitis) — neuroretinitis secondary to cat‑scratch disease (Bartonella henselae), presenting with acute unilateral (right) vision loss, optic disc edema and macular star; infectious etiology confirmed by positive Bartonella IgG and IgM; managed medically with antibiotics, no surgical intervention indicated; prognosis generally good though residual optic atrophy or macular RPE changes possible.
Primary Diagnosis: Optic disc edema with macular star (neuroretinitis)
Secondary Diagnoses: Neuroretinitis (optic disc edema with macular star) secondary to Bartonella henselae infection (cat-scratch disease)
Differential Diagnosis: Demyelinating optic neuritis (typical ON); Infectious neuroretinitis (Bartonella henselae / cat-scratch disease, Lyme, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis); Inflammatory optic neuropathy (sarcoidosis, NMO/NMOSD); Ischemic optic neuropathy (less likely)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy; macular retinal pigment epithelial changes; possible residual visual disability; recurrences in same or fellow eye


Plan
All Medications: antibiotics steroids
Follow-Up Instructions: Reevaluate within 2 weeks for development of a macular star; monitor visual recovery over months with follow-up exams for optic atrophy or macular changes as needed.
Patient Education: Neuroretinitis (optic disc swelling with a macular star) often follows an infection such as cat-scratch disease. It frequently causes sudden, usually one-sided vision loss and eye pain with movement. Many cases improve on their own over weeks to months, but evaluation and testing (blood tests for infections like Bartonella, and sometimes MRI) are important to rule out other causes. If an infectious cause is found, targeted antibiotics may be prescribed. Watch for worsening vision or new symptoms and return promptly. Follow-up eye exams are important because the macular star may appear up to 2 weeks after onset and recovery can be gradual; some residual vision changes may persist. Avoid strenuous overheating activities if they worsen vision; report any new headaches, eye pain, or vision changes immediately.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 58 Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy—Nonarteritic (NAION): A 22‑year‑old woman with 3 weeks of painless (minimal periorbital pain) right visual blurring after a flu‑like illness, right relative afferent pupillary defect, dyschromatopsia, cecocentral scotoma OD, marked sectoral optic disc edema with peripapillary and macular exudates and 1+ vitreous cells OD. Age, vitreous cells, macular star, cat exposure, and positive Bartonella henselae serologies favor infectious neuroretinitis rather than NAION; findings are atypical for NAION (age <40, presence of intraocular inflammation, macular star, lack of vasculopathic risk factors). Final assessment: neuroretinitis (infectious, Bartonella henselae) of the right eye; NAION unlikely.
Primary Diagnosis: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), OS
Differential Diagnosis: Neuroretinitis (infectious or idiopathic); Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION); Arteritic AION (giant cell arteritis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: Risk of AION in the fellow eye (≈12% lifetime); potential permanent visual loss including persistent decreased visual acuity, persistent visual field defects, and increased risk of stroke/myocardial infarction related to shared vascular risk factors


Plan
All Medications: phenytoin erythropoietin intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies topical brimonidine levodopa aspirin corticosteroids
Follow-Up Instructions: The risk of AION in the fellow eye is approximately 12% in the patient’s lifetime; control vascular risk factors and consider aspirin to possibly reduce fellow‑eye/stroke/MI risk (unproven); monitor vision and follow regularly for at least 6 months (expect spontaneous improvement in ~42.7% by 6 months).
Patient Education: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is caused by decreased blood flow to the optic nerve and typically presents as sudden, painless vision loss in one eye. It most often affects people with vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol) and a small optic nerve cup in the other eye. There is no proven treatment that reliably restores vision, although many patients stabilize or improve somewhat over months. Important steps you can take: - Control vascular risk factors: keep blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol well managed, and stop smoking if you smoke. - Take aspirin if recommended by your physician for overall vascular risk reduction (discuss risks/benefits with your doctor). - Report any new vision loss, visual changes, severe headaches, jaw pain, or scalp tenderness immediately (to exclude giant cell arteritis). - Attend follow-up eye exams for visual acuity, visual field, and optic nerve monitoring; many patients show spontaneous improvement over 6 months. - Ask about low-vision services if vision loss affects daily activities; rehabilitation and safety counseling can help maintain function.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 65-year-old woman with acute painless severe vision loss OS on awakening, VA 20/20 OD, 20/200 OS, dense inferior altitudinal field defect OS, left RAPD, diffusely swollen pale left optic disc with peripapillary hemorrhages; elevated ESR (70 mm/h) and CRP (20 mg/dL); temporal artery biopsy positive for giant cell arteritis. Assessment: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (GCA-related AION) of the left eye.
Primary Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (arteritic AION)
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; hypercholesterolemia; diabetes mellitus; polymyalgia rheumatica (history suggested)
Differential Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (giant cell arteritis); Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Optic neuritis; Compressive optic neuropathy
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Further visual loss in the involved or fellow eye (including bilateral blindness); permanent optic atrophy and irreversible vision loss; systemic complications of giant cell arteritis (e.g., stroke, large-vessel ischemia) and corticosteroid-related adverse effects from long-term therapy.


Plan
All Medications: prednisone (oral prednisone 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day), methylprednisolone (IV methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day), methotrexate
All Procedures: Temporal artery biopsy
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful monitoring for visual impairment and constitutional symptoms; serial ESR/CRP testing to gauge disease activity; regular ophthalmology follow-up to assess vision and fellow eye; coordinate care with an internist/rheumatologist for steroid management and consideration of steroid‑sparing therapy if needed; monitor for and manage steroid side effects.
Patient Education: You have giant cell arteritis (a form of vasculitis) causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which has caused sudden vision loss in one eye and can threaten the other eye. Immediate high‑dose corticosteroid treatment is necessary to prevent further or bilateral vision loss; do not delay treatment for biopsy. You will need blood tests (ESR, CRP), a temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, close monitoring of vision and laboratory markers, and coordination with your internist or rheumatologist. Report any new symptoms right away (new vision loss, new headache, jaw pain with chewing, scalp tenderness, fever, or fevers/weight loss). Long‑term steroid therapy with gradual tapering is common; steroids have side effects (high blood pressure, high blood sugar, infection risk, osteoporosis, mood changes) so bone protection, blood‑pressure and glucose monitoring, and possibly steroid‑sparing medications (e.g., methotrexate) may be needed. Follow up promptly for visual checks and lab monitoring as instructed.
Referrals: Internist and/or rheumatologist
Emergency Instructions: Start high‑dose corticosteroids immediately to prevent further visual loss; do not delay treatment for temporal artery biopsy. Seek urgent evaluation by ophthalmology/rheumatology and arrange temporal artery biopsy. If severe recent bilateral vision loss or monocular patient, consider IV methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g/day). Monitor vision, ESR/CRP, and steroid side effects; seek emergency care for any new vision loss, new headaches, jaw claudication, or systemic symptoms.


CASE 60 — Progressive Optic Neuropathy—Tumor
============================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: severe visual loss in the left eye
DURATION: years
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "Over a period of hours, the vision became markedly blurry." "Over the last 2 weeks, she had noted two or three episodes of painless, transient visual loss lasting minutes in the left eye." "She denied any periocular or orbital pain, but noted that over the last several months she had diffuse, dull headaches with occasional superimposed 'ice pick–like' pains affecting her left or right temples." "She reported jaw claudication and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)-like symptoms."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 68-year-old woman with progressive painless visual loss in the left eye over hours to severe blurring, with two to three episodes of transient, painless monocular visual loss in the left eye lasting minutes over the prior 2 weeks, and several months of diffuse dull headaches with intermittent sharp “ice pick–like” temple pains; denies periocular/orbital pain. Also reports hypertension, jaw claudication, and polymyalgia rheumatica–like symptoms.
History Narrative: A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presented with severe visual loss in the left eye. Over a period of hours her vision became markedly blurry; during the prior 2 weeks she had experienced two or three painless, transient episodes of visual loss in the left eye lasting minutes. She denied periocular or orbital pain but reported several months of diffuse, dull headaches with occasional “ice pick–like” pains in the temples. She also reported jaw claudication and polymyalgia rheumatica–like symptoms.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Compressive optic neuropathy of the right optic nerve secondary to an optic nerve sheath meningioma (MRI T1 postcontrast showing optic nerve sheath enhancement). Recommend close clinical observation with serial visual fields and MRIs; consider stereotactic conformal radiation therapy if progressive visual deterioration. Surgical resection generally not recommended unless exophytic growth or intracranial extension threatens the fellow eye. Follow-up every ~6 months with imaging every 6 months for 2 years then annually if stable.
Primary Diagnosis: Compressive optic neuropathy due to optic nerve sheath meningioma
Secondary Diagnoses: Compressive optic neuropathy (optic nerve sheath meningioma)

Complications: Progressive visual loss leading to optic atrophy and permanent vision loss (severe unilateral vision loss), potential involvement of fellow eye if intracranial extension, and risk of chronic visual field defects.


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Serial clinical reevaluation every ~6 months including visual fields and repeat MRIs (e.g., every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly if no growth)
Patient Education: - Explanation that vision loss is due to compression of the optic nerve by a tumor (optic nerve sheath meningioma) and how that causes symptoms (progressive visual decline, color loss, RAPD). - That MRI with contrast is the key test to evaluate this condition and will be used to monitor tumor size and progression. - Management options: observation with regular monitoring if stable; stereotactic/conformal radiation therapy if vision worsens; surgery is rarely recommended and reserved for select cases (exophytic growth or intracranial extension). - Need for regular follow-up visits with visual acuity, color testing, visual fields, and periodic MRI (e.g., every 6 months for 2 years, then annually if stable). - Signs/symptoms that should prompt earlier re-evaluation (sudden or worsening vision loss, new visual field loss, new pain or headaches, changes in pupil reactions). - Discuss potential outcomes: stabilization or improvement sometimes after treatment; risk of permanent vision loss if compression progresses. - Address common questions: expected side effects and goals of radiation therapy; risks and limited role of surgery; importance of timely reporting of changes. - Offer support resources: low-vision services if needed, and contact information for urgent ophthalmology/neuro-ophthalmology if acute changes occur.


CASE 61 — Papilledema–Pseudotumor Cerebri
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: painless progressive visual loss in the right eye
DURATION: 3 years
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "vision was no better after the surgery"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A young obese woman with headaches, tinnitus, transient visual obscurations, and bilateral disc edema; neuroimaging (MRI/MRV) was normal and lumbar puncture demonstrated an elevated opening pressure with normal CSF contents, consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman with a multi-year history of painless progressive visual loss in the right eye. Three years earlier she noted mild visual blurring in the right eye; initial acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS and was attributed to nuclear sclerotic cataract with observation recommended. Over the next year her right vision worsened to 20/60, and she underwent right cataract surgery with a posterior chamber intraocular lens, but her vision continued to deteriorate thereafter. At presentation her visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/20 OS. She denied headache or eye pain. She reported visual color loss (2 of 10 pseudoisochromatic plates OD vs 9 of 10 OS) and diffuse right visual field depression with a normal left field. Examination showed a right relative afferent pupillary defect, pupils 5 mm bilaterally poorly reactive to light on the right and briskly reactive on the left, normal motility, mild right proptosis (Hertel 22 mm OD, 19 mm OS at base 95), a posterior chamber IOL OD and mild nuclear sclerotic cataract OS, and fundus exam revealed a pale, atrophic right optic nerve with a normal left optic disc.
Symptom Duration: 3 years
Progression: Progressive
Characteristics: Papilledema with bilateral optic nerve head edema, headaches, tinnitus, transient visual obscurations, elevated opening pressure (350 mm H2O), normal CSF contents, MRI showing enlarged optic nerve sheaths and empty sella, MRV normal, obese female (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Papilledema due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) — obese middle‑aged woman with headaches, tinnitus, transient visual obscurations, bilateral optic disc edema on exam and MRI signs of raised intracranial pressure (enlarged optic nerve sheaths, empty sella), normal MRV, normal CSF composition, and markedly elevated lumbar puncture opening pressure (350 mm H2O). Management options discussed include weight loss and medical therapy with acetazolamide (1–2 g/day) and other diuretics, with surgical options (CSF shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration) reserved for progressive vision loss or medical therapy failure; close ophthalmologic follow‑up with serial visual fields, disc photos/OCT, VA, color vision, and RAPD testing recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) with papilledema
Differential Diagnosis: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri); compressive optic neuropathy (orbital/intracanalicular tumor such as meningioma); optic atrophy from chronic optic neuritis or ischemic optic neuropathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: vision loss


Plan
All Medications: acetazolamide; methazolamide; furosemide; corticosteroids
All Procedures: MRI brain and orbits with and without gadolinium; MRV; Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) with opening pressure measurement; Acetazolamide medical therapy (pharmacologic treatment); Weight reduction (including bariatric surgery) as treatment option; Ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal CSF shunt; Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF); Serial formal visual fields, optic disc photography, and OCT RNFL for monitoring
Follow-Up Instructions: Return monthly for 6 to 12 months with careful evaluation of formal visual fields, stereo-optic disc photos, OCT nerves, visual acuity, color vision, and RAPD testing; lengthen intervals once stable but continue long-term follow-up for possible recurrence or shunt failure.
Patient Education: Explain that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) is increased pressure around the brain causing headaches, vision changes, pulsatile tinnitus, and swollen optic nerves; stress the importance of prompt monitoring and treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. Recommend weight loss as a core treatment (dietary changes, supervised programs or bariatric surgery for morbid obesity). Describe medical therapy options (acetazolamide as first-line to lower CSF production; possible add-on furosemide; short-term steroids only in select cases) and discuss risks (acetazolamide avoided early in pregnancy; diuretics/corticosteroids have side effects). Explain diagnostic steps already done (normal MRI/MRV, high lumbar puncture opening pressure with normal CSF contents) and that repeat neuroimaging or lumbar puncture may be needed if symptoms change. Outline potential surgical options if vision worsens despite medical therapy: optic nerve sheath fenestration to protect vision and CSF shunting (lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal) to lower pressure; note benefits and risks and that choice is individualized. Emphasize need for frequent follow-up with visual acuity, visual fields, optic nerve photos/OCT and prompt reporting of new or worsening symptoms (new visual loss, persistent headaches, worsening tinnitus, transient visual obscurations, or double vision). Advise discussion of pregnancy planning with neurologist/obstetrician before treatment changes. Provide reassurance that many patients improve with weight loss and medical therapy but long-term monitoring is required.
Referrals: Neuro-ophthalmology and neurosurgery consultation (for consideration of CSF shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right optic neuropathy with junctional scotoma secondary to compressive lesion at the junction of the right optic nerve and chiasm—consistent with a pituitary adenoma causing ipsilateral optic atrophy, right central scotoma, right RAPD, and contralateral superior-temporal visual field defect.
Primary Diagnosis: Right optic neuropathy with junctional scotoma secondary to compressive lesion of the right optic nerve–chiasm junction (pituitary adenoma)
Secondary Diagnoses: Pituitary adenoma (compressive suprasellar lesion)
Differential Diagnosis: Pituitary tumor (sellar/suprasellar adenoma) causing junctional compression; Suprasellar meningioma; Craniopharyngioma; Supraclinoid aneurysm
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy; progressive permanent visual loss (right optic neuropathy with junctional scotoma); possible need for hormone replacement; potential recurrence or residual tumor requiring chemo/radiation; risk of blindness


Plan
All Procedures: Decompressive surgery (surgical removal of pituitary adenoma); periodic MRIs; serial ophthalmologic examinations with visual field testing every 4 months for 1 year then every 6 months thereafter.
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up ophthalmologic exam with visual field testing every 4 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter, with periodic MRIs to monitor for tumor growth.
Patient Education: The visual loss is from a compressive pituitary tumor pressing where the optic nerve meets the optic chiasm, causing a right optic neuropathy and a junctional scotoma. Treatment usually requires surgical decompression and may include hormone therapy or medical treatment if the tumor is a prolactinoma; radiation or chemotherapy may be needed if surgery is subtotal. Prompt treatment can prevent further vision loss but some deficits may be permanent; regular ophthalmic follow-up with visual fields and periodic MRI surveillance are necessary (initially every 4 months for a year, then about every 6 months). Seek urgent care for sudden worsening vision, new double vision, severe headache, or hormonal symptoms (e.g., menstrual changes, libido changes, unexplained fatigue).
Referrals: Neurosurgery for decompressive tumor resection; Endocrinology for pituitary hormone evaluation and management; Neuro-ophthalmology follow-up.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 63-year-old with progressive, painless visual loss and headaches found to have a bitemporal hemianopia on formal visual field testing. Examination notable for decreased VA OD (20/80) with color vision loss and a right relative afferent pupillary defect, diffuse optic disc pallor OD, and normal left eye exam. Findings are most consistent with chiasmal compression from a pituitary macroadenoma on MRI. Management includes neurosurgical evaluation for decompression, endocrinologic assessment and medical therapy if a prolactinoma is suspected, and scheduled postoperative/serial visual field and MRI follow-up.
Primary Diagnosis: Bitemporal visual field defect secondary to pituitary macroadenoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Pituitary macroadenoma; Bitemporal hemianopia due to chiasmal compression; Junctional scotoma (right optic nerve involvement)
Differential Diagnosis: Pituitary macroadenoma; Craniopharyngioma; Meningioma; Chiasmal glioma
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: visual field loss (bitemporal hemianopia), optic neuropathy with optic disc pallor, progressive vision loss, potential hormonal/endocrine dysfunction requiring replacement, recurrence after surgery, need for postoperative radiation therapy


Plan
All Medications: bromocriptine
All Procedures: Neuroimaging (preferably MRI of the sella); surgical resection of pituitary adenoma; postoperative endocrinologic follow-up and hormonal replacement as needed; postoperative radiation therapy (if required); serial visual field and ophthalmologic examinations (postop at ~3 months, then 6-month intervals for 2 years, yearly for 5 years, then every 2 years); serial MRI studies (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, then yearly for several years); medical therapy for prolactinomas (bromocriptine)
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative visual field and ophthalmologic examination as soon as tolerated; then visual fields and ophthalmologic exam at 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, yearly for 5 years, and every 2 years thereafter. Repeat MRI at 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly for several years.
Patient Education: You have a lesion compressing the optic chiasm (most likely a pituitary tumor) causing bitemporal visual field loss. This explains your peripheral (side) vision loss and symptoms such as accidents or unawareness of field loss. Recommended next steps: urgent neuroimaging (MRI of the sella) to confirm the diagnosis and assess tumor size; referral to a neurosurgeon and endocrinologist for evaluation of surgical and hormonal management; visual field and ophthalmic testing to document baseline vision. If the tumor is a prolactinoma, medications (e.g., bromocriptine) may be effective; many other pituitary masses require surgical removal (transsphenoidal surgery), sometimes followed by radiation. Post-treatment follow-up includes repeat visual fields, regular ophthalmic exams (e.g., 3 months, then serially), and periodic MRI (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, then yearly) to monitor for improvement or recurrence. Report new symptoms promptly (worsening vision, severe headache, nausea/vomiting, sudden vision loss) as these may indicate acute enlargement or pituitary apoplexy. Discuss hormone testing and possible replacement with your endocrinologist.
Referrals: Neurosurgery (for pituitary mass evaluation/surgical treatment); Endocrinology (pre- and postoperative hormonal evaluation and management)
Work Restrictions: Avoid driving and operating heavy machinery until visual fields improve and clinician clears; restrictions on night driving if persistent field loss; may require temporary work modification for tasks requiring full peripheral vision; follow-up ophthalmology/neurologic clearance before return to full duties.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right occipital lobe infarction causing a dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia consistent with a retrochiasmal visual pathway lesion; risk-factor management for stroke and secondary prevention recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarction causing a dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; diabetes mellitus; hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarction (retrochiasmal stroke); Parietal lobe infarct affecting optic radiations; Optic tract lesion (contralateral homonymous hemianopia)
Severity: Dense
Laterality: Left
Complications: Difficulty reading (losing place/missing lines), impaired driving with motor vehicle collisions/bumper damage, and increased risk of accidents due to reduced visual field.


Plan
All Medications: Acetaminophen; aspirin (recommended for stroke prophylaxis)
All Procedures: MRI with and without gadolinium (sellar region)
Follow-Up Instructions: Repeat visual fields and ophthalmologic examination approximately 6 months after onset to assess for improvement.
Patient Education: You have a homonymous hemianopia—loss of the same half of the visual field in both eyes—due to a stroke in the right occipital lobe. This explains your difficulty reading (losing your place or missing lines) and problems with driving/parking. Key points and recommendations: - Cause and prognosis: This is from a retrochiasmal (brain) lesion; some spontaneous improvement can occur over months but large permanent deficits are common. Repeat visual fields and eye exam about 6 months after onset to check for recovery. - Safety: Avoid driving until formally cleared by your physician and local licensing authority. Be cautious with mobility—use extra care when parking, crossing streets, and navigating unfamiliar places. - Reading strategies: Use a ruler or line guide, enlarge text, increase contrast and lighting, and slow down. Practice systematic scanning (making larger saccades) toward the blind side to improve search strategies. - Rehabilitation options: Consider referral to low-vision services or occupational therapy for training in scanning techniques and compensatory strategies. Prism glasses (monocular sector prisms) may help shift images into the seeing field for some patients. - Medical care: Continue vascular risk factor control (blood pressure, diabetes, lipids, smoking cessation) and follow your neurologist regarding stroke prevention (e.g., antiplatelet therapy if indicated). - Resources: Ask your provider for referral to low-vision rehabilitation, occupational therapy, and driving-assessment programs. Provide printed or online materials about homonymous hemianopia and local support services. If you notice any sudden worsening, new neurological symptoms, or visual loss, seek immediate medical attention.
Work Restrictions: Avoid driving and operating motor vehicles; limit tasks requiring full peripheral visual fields (use visual aids and supervised rehabilitation); re-evaluate at 6 months for return-to-duty decisions.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate medical care only if new or worsening neurologic symptoms occur (sudden vision loss, weakness, numbness, speech disturbance, severe headache, or loss of consciousness). Otherwise follow-up with ophthalmology/neurology for visual fields and stroke risk‑factor management; call your doctor promptly for new symptoms.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Retinal emboli from right carotid stenosis causing transient monocular visual loss; evaluate for carotid/aortic vascular disease and cardiac embolic sources, initiate antiplatelet therapy and stroke‑risk factor control, consider carotid endarterectomy or stenting if ipsilateral stenosis ≥70% and patient is suitable.
Primary Diagnosis: Retinal emboli secondary to right carotid stenosis causing transient monocular visual loss
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; hyperlipidemia; diabetes; prior coronary artery bypass graft (6 weeks prior)
Differential Diagnosis: Retrochiasmal (occipital or optic radiation) infarction (e.g., PCA stroke); Lateral geniculate body or optic tract infarction; Space-occupying lesion of occipital/temporal/parietal lobe (tumor, abscess); Demyelinating disease (e.g., MS)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: right
Complications: Stroke


Plan
All Medications: aspirin
All Procedures: Carotid endarterectomy; Carotid stenting; Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or other); Anticoagulation (for cardiac valvular/AF embolic source); Noninvasive carotid surveillance (carotid Doppler or MR angiography); Neuroimaging (CT in acute setting, MRI otherwise)
Follow-Up Instructions: Medical supervision of stroke risk factors and periodic reevaluation of the carotid artery for restenosis with noninvasive studies (e.g., carotid Doppler or MR angiography).
Patient Education: Explain that transient monocular vision loss (TMVL) can be caused by tiny cholesterol or platelet emboli from the carotid arteries, heart, or aortic valve and may signal increased stroke risk. Advise urgent vascular and cardiac evaluation (carotid imaging, ECG/echocardiography, and possibly hypercoagulable or inflammatory testing) and that neuroimaging (MRI/CT) is indicated. Emphasize controlling stroke risk factors—blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adherence to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy if prescribed. Discuss symptoms that require immediate emergency care (persistent vision loss, new weakness, numbness, slurred speech, severe headache) and the importance of follow-up with vascular surgery/cardiology and ophthalmology for ongoing monitoring and possible carotid intervention if high-grade stenosis is found.
Referrals: Carotid vascular evaluation (carotid Doppler/MRA) and vascular surgery (carotid endarterectomy/stenting) referral; cardiology (evaluate cardiac/aortic embolic source, valvular disease, arrhythmia) referral; neurology/stroke service; rheumatology (evaluate for giant cell arteritis)

CASE 67 — Third Nerve Palsy—Aneurysm
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Binocular diplopia and right eyelid droop (ptosis) with right periorbital/retro‑orbital pain
DURATION: 4 weeks
LATERALITY: left
PATIENT QUOTES: "stabilized" and in fact had "improved" since his right eye "dropped."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 70-year-old man with a 4-week history of binocular diplopia that developed and worsened over five days then stabilized and partially improved after his right eyelid drooped; associated severe right retro-orbital pain in the first two weeks that subsequently lessened; noted right eyelid droop/ptosis with marked impairment of right eye elevation, adduction, and depression but full abduction; no facial numbness, recent headache, jaw claudication, or other neurologic deficits; past history of hypertension, diabetes, bilateral cataract extraction, and one-pack-per-day smoking.
History Narrative: A 70-year-old man had a 4-week history of binocular diplopia. The diplopia developed and worsened over a 5-day period, but it then “stabilized” and in fact had “improved” since his right eye “dropped.” In the first 2 weeks, he had also noticed severe retro-orbital pain on the right but this pain became minimal. He had a history of bilateral cataract extraction but his vision had otherwise been “stable.” He had a past history of hypertension and diabetes. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily. He denied any facial numbness, recent headache, jaw claudications, or other neurologic deficits. Examination revealed visual acuity of 20/30 on the right and 20/25 on the left. Pupils were 3mm bilaterally and both reacted well to light and near. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Visual fields were normal. He had complete ptosis of his right lid with markedly impaired levator function. He could not adduct, elevate, or depress the right eye but he could fully abduct the eye. Attempts at depression of the right eye resulted in mild incyclodeviation of the eye (consistent with an intact ipsilateral fourth nerve). Motility was normal in the left eye. There was no proptosis, facial sensation was normal, and general neurologic exam was otherwise normal. Slit-lamp exam revealed bilateral posterior chamber intraocular lenses. Fundus exam revealed mild bilateral diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy without optic disc pathology.
Symptom Onset: 4-week history
Symptom Duration: 4 weeks
Progression: Improved then stabilized
Characteristics: Left-sided (left) pupil-involving partial third nerve palsy with ptosis, impaired elevation/adduction/depression, anisocoria (left pupil larger), acute binocular diplopia, periorbital pain; due to posterior communicating artery aneurysm.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Eye movements (attempts at elevation, adduction, and depression) — i.e., attempted ocular motility (gaze with affected eye)
Alleviating Factors: Eye patching to relieve the diplopia
Associated Symptoms: binocular diplopia, left-sided frontal-periorbital pain, left-sided lid droop (ptosis), anisocoria, partial ophthalmoplegia with impaired elevation, adduction, and depression, retro-orbital pain, severe ptosis, diplopia worsening over 5 days then stabilizing/improving, mild headache (history mentions headaches minimal), no facial numbness, no jaw claudication, no other neurologic deficits
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — intermittent disabling diplopia and severe ptosis affecting reading, driving, and daily visual tasks; requires eye patching for function and likely limits activities until treated.
Systemic Symptoms: Hypertension; diabetes; smoker (1 pack/day)
Recent Travel: No recent travel reported
Risk Factors: Hypertension; diabetes mellitus; cigarette smoking; age (older adult)

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Mild diabetic retinopathy (nonproliferative) bilaterally; periphery without retinal tears/detachments noted


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Partial third nerve palsy (TNP) of the left eye with pupillary involvement most consistent with compression from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm based on acute onset binocular diplopia, ipsilateral periorbital pain, ptosis, marked limitation of adduction, elevation and depression with spared abduction, and anisocoria. Neuroimaging (CT/CTA) confirmed a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Pupillary involvement and motor deficits indicate a compressive etiology requiring neurosurgical/endovascular repair.
Primary Diagnosis: Partial third nerve palsy due to posterior communicating artery aneurysm
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus; Bilateral posterior chamber intraocular lenses; Mild bilateral diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy; History of smoking (current smoker, 1 pack/day)
Differential Diagnosis: Posterior communicating artery aneurysm causing compressive third nerve palsy; Ischemic (diabetic/hypertensive) third nerve palsy; Pituitary/sellar mass or other compressive lesion; Myasthenia gravis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: left
Complications: Aneurysmal rupture leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage (high morbidity and mortality)


Plan
All Procedures: CT/CTA; MRI/MRA (recommended as part of workup); cerebral digital subtraction angiography (catheter angiography); surgical or endovascular repair of the posterior communicating artery aneurysm; patching of the eye for diplopia relief
Follow-Up Instructions: Patching the eye to relieve the diplopia; monitor for any worsening (new pupil involvement or neurologic signs) and arrange neuroimaging/vascular repair as indicated (CTA/MRA and possible DSA) with ophthalmology/neurosurgery follow-up.
Patient Education: You have a third nerve (oculomotor) palsy caused by an aneurysm compressing the nerve. This explains your drooping eyelid, double vision, and pupil enlargement. Because aneurysms can rupture with serious consequences, definitive treatment (surgical clipping or endovascular repair) is recommended to prevent rupture. While awaiting or after repair, patching or occluding one eye can relieve double vision. If you develop worsening headache, sudden severe eye/face pain, sudden vision loss, increasing eyelid droop, or new weakness/numbness, seek emergency care immediately. Control vascular risk factors (blood pressure, blood sugar) and stop smoking. Follow-up with your neurosurgeon/interventional radiologist and neuro-ophthalmologist for treatment planning and postoperative vision/motility rehabilitation.
Referrals: Neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology for aneurysm repair (surgical or endovascular)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 56-year-old patient with Type II diabetes presenting with 3 months of binocular horizontal diplopia, worse on left gaze. Exam notable for 4 PD esotropia and limitation of abduction of the left eye consistent with a left lateral rectus paresis. Associated left facial numbness in V1 distribution and left-sided headache. MRI demonstrated a cavernous sinus meningioma. Impression: left sixth cranial nerve palsy with involvement of the left ophthalmic (V1) branch of the trigeminal nerve due to a cavernous sinus meningioma; diplopia management options include patching, prisms, early ipsilateral medial rectus botulinum injection, and consideration of surgery or radiation directed at the meningioma with strabismus surgery later if persistent.
Primary Diagnosis: Left sixth nerve palsy secondary to cavernous sinus meningioma
Secondary Diagnoses: Damage to the left ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) secondary to cavernous sinus meningioma; type II diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Left sixth nerve palsy secondary to cavernous sinus lesion (e.g., meningioma); ischemic (vasculopathic) sixth nerve palsy; myasthenia gravis; thyroid eye disease
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: left facial numbness and sensory changes in distribution of ophthalmic branch (V1); left-sided headache; persistent diplopia; potential residual ophthalmoplegia and need for strabismus surgery


Plan
All Procedures: patching; prisms; botulinum injection into the ipsilateral medial rectus; strabismus surgery; surgery or radiation therapy for the underlying lesion (e.g., meningioma)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe for recurrence of neurologic or ophthalmologic deficits; follow-up for ongoing symptomatic diplopia management (patching, prisms, botulinum injection, or strabismus surgery as indicated) and return for neuroimaging/neurosurgical or radiation consultation and further treatment of the underlying lesion as needed.
Patient Education: The diplopia (double vision) is caused by a weakness of the nerve that moves the left eye outward (left sixth nerve palsy) due to a tumor (meningioma) in the cavernous sinus. Treatment focuses on the tumor (observation, surgery, or radiation as recommended by your specialists) and on relieving the double vision in the short term with an eye patch, prism glasses, or temporary botulinum injection to the inner eye muscle. Strabismus surgery may be considered later if eye alignment and double vision do not improve. You should be monitored regularly for any new or worsening neurological symptoms (increased double vision, drooping eyelid, changes in facial sensation, headache, or vision loss) and follow up with neurosurgery/otolaryngology and ophthalmology for imaging and management decisions.
Referrals: Neuro-ophthalmology and neurosurgery (for cavernous sinus meningioma management; consider radiation oncology for radiosurgery)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 35-year-old woman with history of hyperthyroidism treated with radioactive iodine one year ago presenting with 2 months of bilateral eye irritation, diplopia, lid retraction/lag, proptosis, restricted elevation/depression and abduction, and mild punctate keratopathy. Findings and history are most consistent with active thyroid ophthalmopathy (thyroid eye disease) with extraocular muscle involvement causing restrictive motility disturbance and exposure-related ocular surface disease. No optic neuropathy is described. Management focuses on optimizing thyroid status, smoking cessation, ocular surface lubrication, conservative measures for exposure, consideration of systemic steroids or orbital radiation if inflammation worsens, and delaying strabismus/eyelid/orbital decompression surgery until disease is inactive (stable 6–12 months).
Primary Diagnosis: Thyroid orbitopathy
Secondary Diagnoses: Hyperthyroidism (history of radioactive iodine treatment); dry eye/keratopathy; lid retraction and lid lag; diplopia; restrictive extraocular myopathy (thyroid eye disease)
Differential Diagnosis: Thyroid (Graves) orbitopathy; Ocular myasthenia gravis; Cranial nerve VI palsy (bilateral); Idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital myositis)
Severity: Mild to moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Exposure keratopathy; diplopia; compressive optic neuropathy leading to visual loss; globe luxation; cosmesis and eyelid retraction-related problems


Plan
All Medications: radioactive iodine, methylcellulose artificial tears, ointment (ocular), systemic corticosteroids, neostigmine (Prostigmin), edrophonium (Tensilon), botulinum toxin

Follow-Up Instructions: Close ophthalmologic supervision with monitoring of visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and fundus for optic neuropathy; monitor for corneal epithelial breakdown and need for more aggressive treatment; coordinated, long-term follow-up with endocrinology and ophthalmology as part of a multidisciplinary team.
Patient Education: Stop smoking; maintain thyroid control with your endocrinologist. Use lubricating drops during the day and ointment at night; elevate head of bed and use dark glasses for photophobia. Protect eyes at night (taping lids or humidified goggles) if exposure symptoms. Use prism, patching, or botulinum toxin short-term for diplopia; report worsening vision, pain, or increased redness/foreign-body sensation promptly. Expect prolonged course; close follow-up with ophthalmology and endocrinology; surgery (decompression → strabismus → lid surgery) only after disease stabilizes.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Isolated, idiopathic tonic pupil — right anisocoria with a dilated, poorly light-reactive, segmentally reactive right pupil with vermiform iris movements and light–near dissociation consistent with Adie (tonic) pupil. Reassurance; no specific medical or surgical treatment indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Isolated, idiopathic tonic pupil
Secondary Diagnoses: Anisocoria (tonic/Adie’s pupil)
Differential Diagnosis: Isolated idiopathic tonic pupil (Adie’s pupil); Holmes–Adie syndrome; Pharmacologic pupillary dilation; Oculomotor (third nerve) palsy
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: No significant complications; typically none — mostly benign with possible persistent accommodative paresis and induced astigmatism.


Plan
All Medications: thyroid supplements
All Procedures: Slit-lamp examination Static perimetry (visual field testing) Hertel exophthalmometry Duction testing Forced duction testing (recommended) Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits (recommended) Dilute pilocarpine testing (pharmacologic testing for cholinergic supersensitivity)
Follow-Up Instructions: No treatment, except reassurance; use unequal bifocal reading aids or a unilateral frosted bifocal segment if accommodative paresis is permanent; observe for pupil size change over time and possible bilateral involvement (≈4%/yr).
Patient Education: This condition (tonic/Adie’s pupil) is benign and usually not sight‑threatening. Its main features are a pupil that reacts poorly to light but better for near vision, possible blurred near vision or difficulty focusing, and sometimes a mild, fluctuating eye discomfort. No specific treatment is typically required—reassurance is appropriate. For persistent near-vision difficulty, simple measures include unequal bifocals or a unilateral frosted bifocal segment to reduce symptoms. Monitor for any new symptoms (worsening vision, increased pain, double vision, or systemic symptoms like fainting or muscle weakness) and return for reevaluation if they occur. If the pupil causes cosmetic concern, discuss options with your ophthalmologist.

She reported occasional headaches over several years but denied other illnesses, significant head or eye trauma, use of any eye drops, or visual symptoms. She saw a neurosurgeon who obtained a normal brain MRI and suggested a possible cerebral angiogram. On exam visual acuity was 20/20 OU, color vision and visual fields were normal. The right pupil measured 6 mm in darkness and reacted poorly and segmentally to light; the left pupil measured 3 mm and reacted briskly. The right pupil constricted slowly to near and redilated slowly at distance; the left constricted briskly to near and redilated quickly. Extraocular motility was normal and there was no ptosis. Slit-lamp exam showed vermiform, segmental movements of a sector of the right iris; fundus exam was normal.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Postganglionic Horner’s syndrome of the left eye due to spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery — confirmed by pharmacologic testing (10% cocaine showed poor left pupillary dilation; 1% hydroxyamphetamine showed poor dilation of the left pupil consistent with postganglionic lesion). Ptosis ~2 mm on the left. No ocular motility deficit. Managed medically with anticoagulation (Coumadin for 3 months) then aspirin; Horner’s syndrome itself requires no surgical treatment.
Primary Diagnosis: Postganglionic Horner’s syndrome due to spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery
Secondary Diagnoses: Horner’s syndrome (postganglionic, left)
Differential Diagnosis: Tonic (Adie) pupil; Pharmacologic mydriasis; Third cranial nerve palsy; Iris structural damage
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: cocaine 10%, hydroxyamphetamine 1%, pilocarpine 1%, pilocarpine 0.125%, Coumadin (warfarin), aspirin
All Procedures: Topical 10% cocaine instillation in both eyes; Topical 1% hydroxyamphetamine instillation in both eyes; MRI of the brain; Anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin) therapy for 3 months; Maintenance aspirin therapy thereafter
Follow-Up Instructions: Cases in which no etiology is evident require close observation to investigate for the development of other neurologic or medical signs or symptoms.
Patient Education: Horner’s syndrome itself does not require treatment, but it is important to identify and treat the underlying cause (in this case a carotid artery dissection). You may notice an uneven pupil size and mild drooping of the eyelid; these signs may improve as the underlying problem is treated. Expect vascular treatment as recommended by your physician (this patient received anticoagulation followed by antiplatelet therapy). No surgery is typically needed. Close follow‑up is important to monitor for new neurologic symptoms or changes and to ensure the underlying cause is resolving.

CASE 76 — Leukocoria
====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Leukocoria
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 3-year-old boy referred for persistent poor vision and esotropia; diagnosed at age 2 with right-eye esotropia and amblyopia with prescribed full-time patching of the left eye done sporadically for ~6 months without improvement. Parents noted leukocoria of the left eye. Current exam: best-corrected VA 20/200 OD, 20/30 OS; 25 PD constant esotropia at distance and near with full motility; 1+ RAPD in the right eye; cycloplegic refraction +1.25 D OU. Initial posterior pole exam suggested normal disc/macula/vessels but careful review revealed small, crowded, pale right optic disc with double-ring sign and smaller left disc. No significant medical history except height/weight at 15th percentile; no family history of strabismus/amblyopia.
History Narrative: A 3-year-old boy is referred by another ophthalmologist. The child was diagnosed with esotropia and amblyopia in the right eye at age 2 years. The referring ophthalmologist prescribed full-time patching of the left eye, which was done sporadically for approximately 6 months. No improvement in the child’s vision was noted, prompting referral for a second opinion and treatment recommendations. The child’s medical history is notable for a weight and height in the 15th percentile, but is otherwise unremarkable. The review of systems is completely negative with the exception of the ophthalmologic complaints and there is no family history of strabismus or amblyopia. The patient is shown in ▶Fig. 85.1. Best-corrected visual acuity is 20/200 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Motility evaluation reveals an esotropia of 25 prism diopters at distance and at near with full ductions and versions. Pupillary testing reveals a 1 + relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the right eye. Cycloplegic refraction is +1.25 diopters in both eyes and initial evaluation of the posterior pole reveals a normal disc, macula, and vessels. The ophthalmologist is concerned by the presence of the RAPD and performs a more careful evaluation of the posterior pole. The disc of the right eye appears slightly pale. The vessels on the nerve are crowded. The disc diameter is small, and a double-ring sign is noted (▶Fig. 85.2a, b). The left disc is also slightly smaller than normal.
Symptom Onset: Age 2 years (esotropia and amblyopia noted at age 2; leukocoria identified by age 3)
Symptom Duration: Approximately 1 year
Progression: Progressive
Characteristics: Leukocoria, bilateral retinoblastoma (left > right), vitreous seeding, exudative retinal detachment, optic nerve involvement risk, hereditary potential (RB1 germline mutation possible), presents with esotropia and RAPD, small/crowded/pale optic discs (optic nerve hypoplasia-like features).


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: Leukocoria, esotropia, decreased vision in right eye (20/200), relative afferent pupillary defect (1+ RAPD) in right eye, optic disc pallor/small crowded disc with double-ring sign, sporadic patching history, growth retardation (height and weight 15th percentile), history of amblyopia.
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — significant visual impairment in the right eye (20/200) and leukocoria/advanced disease in the left with likely loss of vision, causing functional monocular vision affecting depth perception and activities requiring binocular vision; requires protective measures and rehabilitation.
Systemic Symptoms: Completely negative (no systemic symptoms)
Recent Travel: No recent travel
Risk Factors: Hereditary RB1 germline mutation (family history of retinoblastoma or germline mutation), young age (infancy/early childhood), bilateral disease, prior radiation exposure, monocular status increasing trauma risk, increased risk of secondary malignancies (soft-tissue and bony sarcomas)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Bilateral retinoblastoma: the left eye demonstrates advanced disease with leukocoria and greater involvement necessitating enucleation; the right eye has tumor involvement amenable to combined medical and focal surgical therapy. Examination under anesthesia and MRI confirmed bilateral intraocular tumors with left greater than right. Genetic testing for RB1 germline mutation and endocrine evaluation due to associated findings are indicated. Close follow-up with periodic examinations under anesthesia (every 3–4 months until age 5 if germline mutation present) and long-term surveillance for secondary malignancies recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Bilateral retinoblastoma
Differential Diagnosis: Optic nerve hypoplasia; Retinoblastoma; Persistent fetal vasculature (persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Increased risk of secondary malignancies (particularly soft-tissue and bony sarcomas), risk of tumor spread via optic nerve with orbital recurrence, vision loss/monocular status, and potential endocrine abnormalities (from associated septo‑optic dysplasia).


Plan
All Medications: steroids
All Procedures: Examination under anesthesia; Magnetic resonance imaging (brain/orbit); Genetic testing for RB1; Chemotherapy (intravenous, intra-arterial, periocular, and intravitreal as indicated); Focal therapies (laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, radioactive plaque therapy); Enucleation; Fabrication/fitting of protective polycarbonate eyewear and prosthetic/ocular rehabilitation follow-up
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months until age 5 (if RB1 germline mutation present), then frequent exams for several more years with annual eye exams thereafter; examine enucleated socket at each contralateral-eye visit; long-term surveillance for secondary malignancies; protect remaining eye with polycarbonate safety glasses and provide eye-safety education.
Patient Education: Protecting the remaining eye (wear polycarbonate safety glasses), educate family on signs of recurrence and need for frequent follow-up exams (every 3–4 months under anesthesia until age 5 if RB1 germline mutation, then continued regular exams), importance of genetic testing and long‑term surveillance for secondary malignancies (soft‑tissue and bone sarcomas), and adherence to treatment and prompt reporting of new symptoms.
Referrals: Endocrinology (urgent) and pediatrician for endocrine testing and growth monitoring; oncology/ocular oncology for retinoblastoma management and genetic counseling/testing.

Differential Diagnosis: Retinoblastoma; Coats’ disease; Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV); Toxocariasis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: atropine eye drops (topical)
All Procedures: Examination of the eyes under anesthesia; MRI of head and orbits; B-scan and A-scan ocular ultrasonography; genetic counseling/testing (RB1) and general physical examination; enucleation with pathologic examination (if performed)
Follow-Up Instructions: Ophthalmologic follow-up examinations as needed after amblyopia treatment; monitor visual acuity and refractive error periodically, update prescriptions as child ages, and continue/maintain patching or other therapy as indicated (may require maintenance patching until age 7–8 years) to detect and prevent recurrence.
Patient Education: Explain leukocoria is a serious finding needing urgent evaluation; discuss likely causes (retinoblastoma, Coats’ disease, PFV, others) and need for prompt imaging (MRI/orbit and ultrasound) and examination under anesthesia. Explain amblyopia risk and treatment: full cycloplegic refraction and glasses, possible atropine penalization, and patching of the good eye (often 2 hours/day for mild–moderate amblyopia) with regular follow-up to monitor vision and refractive changes. Discuss genetic testing and counseling if retinoblastoma suspected, examination of siblings/parents, and that early treatment improves visual and life prognosis.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmologic evaluation for any worsening vision, new eye pain, redness, or a change in the appearance of the pupil; if retinoblastoma is suspected, urgent referral to a specialist and prompt imaging (MRI of orbits/brain) are required.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right superior oblique palsy with chronic left head tilt and mild facial asymmetry.
Primary Diagnosis: Right superior oblique palsy with chronic left head tilt and mild facial asymmetry
Differential Diagnosis: Amblyopia (anisometropic/refractive); Refractive error (anisometropia/ametropia); Strabismic amblyopia (including superior oblique palsy-related); Deprivational amblyopia (media opacity/ptosis)
Severity: mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Amblyopia (refractive/anisometropic or strabismic) - Persistent abnormal head posture and facial asymmetry - Diplopia (may develop later) - Residual or recurrent vertical deviation (over- or under-correction after surgery) - Postoperative Brown’s syndrome (limitation of elevation in adduction) - Need for additional strabismus surgeries


Plan
All Medications: 1% cyclopentolate
All Procedures: ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment recommendations cycloplegic refraction with 1% cyclopentolate visual acuity testing (Allen figures, HOTV acuity test, Snellen-type recognition testing) stereoacuity testing (Titmus fly) ocular motility evaluation (ductions/versions, cover testing) vertical/horizontal prism dissociation for fixation preference testing vertical prism correction (trial/prism therapy) inferior oblique weakening surgery (myectomy or recession) superior oblique strengthening surgery (tuck) combined oblique and rectus muscle strabismus surgery postoperative ophthalmologic follow-up for fusion, stereopsis, and visual acuity monitoring
Follow-Up Instructions: Parents should be advised at the time of surgery of the potential for over- or under-correction and the possible need for additional surgery in the future; expect possible transient Brown’s syndrome after superior oblique tuck; children should undergo periodic ophthalmologic evaluations focusing on fusion, stereopsis, and visual acuity to detect, prevent, and treat amblyopia.
Patient Education: Explain torticollis and that in children it can be due to eye muscle weakness (ocular torticollis) as well as nonmuscular causes; review that common signs include head tilt, face turn, or chin rotation. Describe that evaluation includes vision testing, eye alignment and movement exam, cycloplegic refraction, and stereo/fixation assessment to look for amblyopia or refractive errors. Explain that treatment options depend on cause: glasses for refractive error, patching/amblyopia therapy if needed, prism for small vertical deviations, and surgery (usually weakening of the inferior oblique or strengthening of the superior oblique) for symptomatic superior oblique palsy or persistent head tilt—surgery may require further procedures and can cause temporary movement limitations. Advise that many mild cases need no surgery and can be observed, and that close follow-up is important to monitor vision, stereopsis, and head posture to detect or prevent amblyopia. Recommend prompt treatment of significant refractive error or amblyopia and returning for regular ophthalmology visits; seek urgent care if new double vision, increasing head tilt, or sudden vision loss occur.


CASE 79 — Aniridia
==================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Anomalous left head tilt since infancy and intermittent eyes not moving together (strabismus)
DURATION: 5 years
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I strongly resist any attempts to straighten my head."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 5-year-old boy referred for evaluation of a constant left head tilt noted since infancy; parents report he has resisted attempts to straighten his head, frequent eye rubbing and blinking, and intermittent misalignment of the eyes for the past 2 months. He fixes and follows well with either eye and alternates fixation; no systemic symptoms and unremarkable family history. Cycloplegic refraction +1.75 +0.75 OD/OS.
History Narrative: A 5-year-old boy is brought to his ophthalmologist’s office at the request of his pediatrician for evaluation of an anomalous head tilt. The child has undergone orthopaedic evaluation and neck muscle abnormalities are absent. The child has had a relatively constant left head tilt since he first gained head control during the first year of life. His parents note that he strongly resists any attempts to straighten his head. During the last 2 months, they have noticed that his eyes sometimes do not appear to move together. Family history is unremarkable and the review of systems is notable only for frequent eye rubbing and blinking behavior.
Symptom Onset: Since infancy (noted since he first gained head control during the first year of life).
Symptom Duration: Since first gained head control during the first year of life (≈ ~4–5 years)
Progression: Progressive (risk of progressive corneal opacification, cataracts, and glaucoma)
Characteristics: Sporadic aniridia with WAGR features (aniridia, developmental delay, genitourinary abnormalities) due to 11p13 deletion; associated photophobia, foveal hypoplasia, risk of corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, and Wilms’ tumor.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Bright light/photophobia (worse in bright lighting)
Alleviating Factors: Occlusion of one eye (patching) is tolerated and reduces symptoms; wearing sunglasses or shaded contact lenses alleviates photophobia.
Associated Symptoms: Photophobia, frequent eye rubbing and blinking, nystagmus (congenital), anomalous head tilt, abnormal head posture, alternating fixation, mild facial asymmetry, decreased visual development (foveal hypoplasia)
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate impact — photophobia, frequent eye rubbing/blinking, and risk of progressive vision loss causing need for low-vision aids and educational intervention; periodic medical visits and abdominal ultrasounds adding burden.
Systemic Symptoms: frequent eye rubbing and blinking behavior; developmental delay; genitourinary abnormalities (renal mass/Wilms' tumor)
Recent Travel: No recent travel
Risk Factors: WAGR syndrome (11p13 deletion) with high risk for Wilms tumor; congenital aniridia (foveal hypoplasia) leading to photophobia, progressive corneal opacification, cataract, and glaucoma; family history unremarkable (sporadic case)

Primary Diagnosis: Sporadic aniridia
Secondary Diagnoses: Aniridia; Foveal hypoplasia; Photophobia; Progressive cataract (risk); Glaucoma (risk); Corneal opacification/vascularization (risk); WAGR syndrome components (developmental delay, genitourinary abnormalities); Wilms tumor (risk)
Differential Diagnosis: Superior oblique palsy; Brown’s syndrome; Dissociated vertical deviation; Congenital fibrosis syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Progressive corneal opacification and vascularization; progressive cataracts; glaucoma; foveal hypoplasia leading to reduced vision; risk of Wilms tumor (renal malignancy) due to WAGR syndrome.


Plan
All Procedures: Comprehensive ocular motility evaluation including three-step test; cycloplegic refraction; fundus examination; abdominal ultrasounds at regular intervals until ~3 years of age; MRI of abdomen if ultrasound abnormality; renal biopsy if MRI suggests Wilms’ tumor; referral to pediatric oncologist if Wilms’ tumor confirmed; periodic ophthalmologic screening examinations; low-vision evaluation; early childhood educational intervention; prescription of sunglasses or shaded contact lenses.
Follow-Up Instructions: Periodic ophthalmological screening exams to monitor for glaucoma, progressive cataract, and corneal opacification; abdominal ultrasounds at regular intervals until ~3 years of age for Wilms’ tumor screening (MRI and biopsy if ultrasound abnormal); referral to pediatric oncologist if Wilms’ tumor confirmed; early childhood educational intervention and low-vision evaluation.
Patient Education: - Explanation of aniridia: a congenital (present at birth) condition where the iris is absent or underdeveloped, causing light sensitivity, reduced visual acuity, and possible nystagmus. - Common associated risks: progressive corneal problems, cataracts, glaucoma, foveal hypoplasia (poor central vision), and, when part of WAGR syndrome, risk of Wilms’ tumor (kidney cancer). - Symptom management: wear sunglasses or shaded/contact lenses for photophobia; avoid eye rubbing. - Surveillance recommendations: regular ophthalmology exams to monitor vision, cornea, lens, and intraocular pressure; periodic low-vision evaluation and early educational/rehabilitation services. - Systemic screening (if syndromic/WAGR suspected): renal ultrasound regularly until about age 3 to screen for Wilms’ tumor; further imaging (MRI) and oncologic referral if abnormalities are found. - When to seek urgent care: sudden change in vision, new eye pain, redness, abnormal eye position, or any abdominal mass/abdominal pain.
Referrals: Pediatric oncologist for confirmed Wilms’ tumor; low-vision/early childhood educational services.


CASE 80 — Retinopathy of Prematurity
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: “jiggling eyes” and large pupils
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 9-month-old boy referred for “jiggling eyes” and large pupils first noted during the first month of life; parents report photophobia (closes eyes in bright sunlight) and apparent reduced vision compared with siblings; born at term with prenatal care and no perinatal complications; past medical history notable for hypospadias repair 2 months earlier and developmental delay.
History Narrative: A 9-month-old boy is referred to his ophthalmologist with a history of “jiggling eyes” and large pupils, both noted during the first month of life. The child closes his eyes in bright sunlight and does not appear to see as well as his two older siblings. The boy was born at term, the mother received prenatal care, and there were no perinatal complications. The child’s medical history is notable for a hypospadias repair 2 months earlier and for developmental delay. He has two healthy siblings and two healthy parents with no significant family history of ophthalmologic or medical problems. On examination, the child appears to fix and follow, but the fixation behavior is abnormal. A low-amplitude/high-frequency horizontal pendular nystagmus is noted. Examination reveals peripheral corneal opacification and vascularization. The child appears to have only a very small peripheral remnant of iris and an anterior pyramidal cataract is noted in both eyes. Retinal examination is notable for the absence of an obvious umbo or foveal pigmentation. The child’s parents and two older siblings were examined and found to have normal ophthalmologic examinations.
Symptom Onset: first month of life
Symptom Duration: 9 months
Characteristics: Type I retinopathy of prematurity (severe ROP: stage 3 with plus disease) characterized by abnormal retinal neovascularization with plus disease, requiring treatment (laser or intravitreal anti-VEGF); risk of progression to retinal detachment and associated high myopia, strabismus, amblyopia.

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Avascular peripheral retina to the ora serrata in both eyes


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Type I retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) bilaterally — severe posterior vasoproliferative disease requiring urgent treatment (laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-VEGF). Close, frequent retinal follow-up until disease regression with continued screening up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age for possible late reactivation. Educate caregivers regarding risk of associated visual sequelae (amblyopia, strabismus, high refractive error) and coordinate neonatal/pediatric care for systemic monitoring as indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Retinopathy of prematurity (Type I, both eyes)
Secondary Diagnoses: Retinopathy of prematurity; Stage 3+ ROP (Type I, both eyes); Prematurity-related complications (risk for amblyopia, strabismus, severe refractive error)
Differential Diagnosis: Aniridia; Retinopathy of prematurity; Congenital cataract; Albinism
Severity: Type I
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: cataract; subretinal hemorrhage; intraretinal hemorrhage; vitreous hemorrhage; severe myopia; amblyopia; strabismus; severe refractive error (myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia); late disease reactivation


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab
All Procedures: intravitreal injection of bevacizumab; cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematurity; laser photocoagulation (peripheral retinal photocoagulation); frequent ophthalmic examinations (post-treatment monitoring)
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequent ophthalmic examinations until ROP has regressed; for bevacizumab-treated infants, continuous screening up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age for late reactivation.
Patient Education: Premature infants treated for type I ROP or at risk should have frequent eye exams until disease regression; if treated with bevacizumab they need continued screening up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age because of possible late reactivation. Parents should be counseled about risks of amblyopia, strabismus, and significant refractive errors (myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia) and the need for long‑term ophthalmic follow‑up.
Referrals: Genetics consultation and pediatrician follow-up (for Wilms’ tumor screening/abdominal ultrasound)

=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Crossed eyes noted since 2 months of age; recent intermittent inward drift of left eye, worse when tired.
DURATION: 4 years, 10 months
LATERALITY: bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "her left eye has been noted to intermittently drift inward, especially when she is tired."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 5-year-old girl with history of crossed eyes since 2 months of age; had strabismus surgery at 8 months with good alignment afterward until recently when her left eye has been noted to intermittently drift inward, especially when tired.

Symptom Duration: Since 2 months of age
Progression: Recurrent (initially resolved after surgery, now intermittent inward drift of OS)
Characteristics: Intermittent exotropia; pseudodivergence excess type; onset in early childhood with intermittent outward deviation, better control at distance than near, associated with poor nasal-to-temporal OKN, reduced stereopsis, and possible amblyopia risk.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: tiredness
Associated Symptoms: Intermittent inward drift of the left eye (worse when tired)
Previous Episodes: Recurrent exotropia after initial surgery at 8 months of age; intermittent inward drift noted recently since alignment had been good until recently.

Secondary Diagnoses: intermittent exotropia, amblyopia (left eye), inferior oblique overaction, dissociated vertical deviation, V-pattern strabismus, asymmetric OKN (latent nystagmus)
Differential Diagnosis: Infantile (congenital) esotropia; Partially accommodative (refractive) esotropia; Sensory esotropia; Sixth nerve (abducens) palsy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: amblyopia; decreased stereopsis; recurrence of exotropia


Plan
All Medications: cyclopentolate, homatropine, scopolamine, atropine
All Procedures: strabismus surgery (performed at 8 months of age)
Follow-Up Instructions: If medical management: follow-up every 2–6 months for reevaluation. If postoperative: follow-up with healing over ~6 weeks and continued long-term follow-up for recurrence and monitoring for decreased stereopsis or amblyopia.
Patient Education: Intermittent exotropia is a lifelong condition caused by reduced fusion control; it may be managed without surgery if control is good but can worsen over time. Treatment options include updated full hyperopic spectacle correction, patching (alternate or dominant‑eye) to reduce suppression, and — for older children who can cooperate — convergence exercises (e.g., pencil pushups) or orthoptic therapy to improve control. Surgery is considered when control is poor (deviation present >40–50% of the time) or for cosmetic/symptomatic reasons, typically delayed until ≥4 years when possible; procedures depend on exotropia type. Regular follow‑up every 2–6 months during medical management and long‑term monitoring after surgery are important to detect recurrence, decreasing stereopsis, or amblyopia.


CASE 83 — Childhood Ptosis
==========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Intermittent outward drifting of the right eye for 2 years (worse when tired or looking at distance)
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "the deviation is worse when the child is tired or when he is looking at distant objects." "the eye is now deviated outward approximately 60% of the day." "right eye closure in sunlight." "the deviation is worse at distance than near."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 4‑year‑old boy with a 2‑year history of intermittent outward drifting of the right eye, worse when tired or looking at distance, initially occurring 2–3 times/day but progressively more frequent and now present about 60% of the day; no antecedent trauma, fever, or other medical problems; mother notes right eye closure in sunlight.
History Narrative: A 4-year-old boy presents with a 2-year history of intermittent drifting out of the right eye. His mother states that the deviation is worse when the child is tired or when he is looking at distant objects. His mother initially noted this deviation approximately two to three times a day; however, it recently has been getting worse. She states that the eye is now deviated outward approximately 60% of the day. There is no history of antecedent head trauma, febrile episode, or other medical problem. There is no family history of strabismus or amblyopia. Review of systems is notable for right eye closure in sunlight.
Symptom Onset: 2 years prior (onset at age 2)
Symptom Duration: 2 years
Progression: Worsening over time; increased from occurring 2–3×/day to present ~60% of the day
Characteristics: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid with anomalous chin‑up head posture and absence of amblyopia


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: tiredness/fatigue and looking at distant objects; bright sunlight (causing right eye closure)
Alleviating Factors: recovery of orthotropia on refixation or blinking
Associated Symptoms: Right eye closure in sunlight; intermittent drifting/outward deviation of right eye, worse when tired or looking at distance; anomalous chin‑up head posture.
Previous Episodes: The deviation was initially noted approximately two to three times a day and has progressed to occurring about 60% of the day.
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — intermittent diplopia/eye deviation 60% of day, chin‑up posture and light sensitivity cause functional and cosmetic impact but no amblyopia; may interfere with activities when tired or in sunlight.
Systemic Symptoms: No systemic symptoms reported
Recent Travel: No recent travel

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid with anomalous chin‑up head posture and absence of amblyopia.
Primary Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid
Secondary Diagnoses: Intermittent exotropia (pseudodivergence excess type), anisometropia (mild), stereopsis preserved, no amblyopia
Differential Diagnosis: Intermittent exotropia (pseudodivergence–excess type); Congenital exotropia; Sensory exotropia; Myasthenia gravis
Laterality: Right
Complications: early and late infection, suture granuloma, exposure keratopathy, retrobulbar hemorrhage, overcorrections


Plan
All Procedures: Fasanella–Servat procedure; levator resection; frontalis suspension (using sutures such as Supramid, nylon, Prolene, Gore‑Tex; silicone rods; banked or autogenous fascia lata; palmaris longus tendon)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow the child throughout childhood for surveillance of amblyopia and anisometropia until at least age 7–10 years; monitor visual acuity, stereopsis, and refractive status regularly, reassess after any ptosis surgery (wound healing ~1 month) with attention to lid height and nocturnal lagophthalmos; provide ocular lubrication at night for ~1 month postoperatively (continue long-term if Bell’s reflex absent); monitor for recurrence of ptosis and treat amblyopia promptly if detected.
Patient Education: Congenital ptosis is treated when it affects vision or head posture; watch closely for amblyopia and anisometropia with regular follow-up until at least age 7–10. If amblyopia develops it is treated with occlusion (patching) or pharmacologic/optical penalization and glasses for significant refractive error. Small ptoses may be managed with limited procedures (e.g., Fasanella–Servat); levator resection is versatile for mild–severe ptosis if levator function is adequate; frontalis suspension is used for severe ptosis with poor levator function (autogenous fascia lata gives best long‑term results). Discuss risks of surgery (infection, exposure keratopathy, overcorrection, granuloma) and need for temporary nighttime lubrication and follow‑up for possible recurrence.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Isolated developmental visual maturation (DVM): 17‑month‑old boy with congenital right upper eyelid ptosis consistent with congenital levator hypoplasia (interpalpebral fissures 6.5 mm OD, 10 mm OS; MRD1 0.5 mm OD, 3.5 mm OS; levator function 6 mm OD, 12 mm OS; absent lid crease OD) but with equal, normal fixation and following in both eyes, no fixation preference, full versions, equal reactive pupils without APD, minimal refractive anisometropia (–0.25 +1.50 ×90 OD, +0.50 OS), and preferred 15° chin‑up posture. Findings consistent with isolated DVM; normal development and visual behavior indicate no current surgical indication. Recommend ongoing developmental/neurologic surveillance and follow‑up; pursue further testing only if vision fails to normalize by 6–8 months of age or if neurologic/developmental concerns arise.
Primary Diagnosis: Isolated DVM
Differential Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis (levator muscle dysgenesis); Horner syndrome; Third cranial nerve palsy; Marcus Gunn jaw‑wink ptosis
Severity: Moderate to severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: Amblyopia (from visual axis occlusion or induced astigmatism), exposure keratopathy risk after surgery if Bell’s phenomenon abnormal, associated strabismus, anisometropia/astigmatism, potential underlying neurologic disease (if not isolated)


Plan
All Procedures: exam under anesthesia, funduscopy, refraction, corneal diameter measurement, measurement of intraocular pressure, cycloplegic refraction, slit-lamp examination, motility examination, vertical prism test, cover test (occlusion), electrophysiologic testing, neuroimaging
Follow-Up Instructions: For isolated DVM: expect vision to normalize by 6–8 months; no further evaluation if normal. If vision fails to improve by 6–8 months, obtain electrophysiologic testing and neuroimaging. Periodic developmental and neurologic assessments by the pediatrician; continued monitoring and follow-up if neurologic abnormalities, developmental delay, or ocular findings (visual response may be delayed up to 1–2 years).

================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor vision/not responding to visual stimuli (suspected blindness)
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 3-month-old girl brought by her parents for concerns she may be blind; parents report poor eye contact, lack of response to parental facial expressions, and apparent nonresponse to bright lights. Prenatal and birth histories unremarkable. No prior ophthalmologic or medical problems. Parents note two older siblings who responded visually at this age. Developmentally appears normal. On exam she does not fixate or follow targets, does not respond to facial gestures, but blinks to bright light; occasional OKN beat with equivocal attention; pupils 5 mm, moderately reactive without APD; anterior segment and fundus normal.
History Narrative: A 3-month-old girl is brought to her ophthalmologist by her parents because of concerns that she may be blind.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Septo‑optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia. The patient demonstrates poor visual behavior consistent with optic nerve hypoplasia and has associated growth hormone deficiency causing short stature and low weight. Developmental and neurologic screening are otherwise normal. Endocrine evaluation and pituitary hormone replacement are indicated; ophthalmic management includes monitoring vision, consideration of amblyopia therapy for the better potential eye, protective eyewear for the functional eye, and delayed strabismus surgery after maximal amblyopia treatment.
Primary Diagnosis: Septo-optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia
Secondary Diagnoses: Septo-optic dysplasia; Bilateral asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia; Growth hormone deficiency resulting in short stature and low weight; Esotropia; Functional amblyopia (possible); Pituitary hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism)
Differential Diagnosis: Delayed visual maturation; Cortical visual impairment; Bilateral structural ocular pathology (e.g., optic nerve hypoplasia, retinal or corneal/lenticular disease)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Variable visual loss up to blindness (range: no light perception to 20/20) - Nystagmus - Strabismus (esotropia) with risk of recurrence after surgery - Amblyopia (functional component in affected eye) - Endocrine/hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (growth hormone deficiency, other pituitary hormone deficiencies) - Associated intracranial malformations (septo-optic dysplasia, absence of septum pellucidum, corpus callosum hypoplasia) - Need for lifelong endocrine monitoring and risk of delayed-onset hormonal abnormalities - Increased risk to the better-seeing eye (functional monocular status)


Plan
All Medications: pituitary hormone replacement as needed; stress‑dose corticosteroids when indicated; botulinum toxin (for strabismus)
All Procedures: VEP testing EEG (if indicated) Electroretinogram (if indicated) Neuroimaging (MRI) Endocrinology evaluation and pituitary hormone replacement Amblyopia therapy (trial) Strabismus surgery or botulinum toxin injection Prescription of polycarbonate safety spectacles
Follow-Up Instructions: - Ongoing evaluation of growth and endocrine parameters throughout early childhood, even if initially normal (monitor for delayed-onset endocrine abnormalities up to 3–4 years of age) - Continue care with an endocrinologist and provide pituitary hormone replacement as needed with close growth‑parameter follow-up - Administer stress‑dose corticosteroids during acute illness, surgery, or serious injury if corticotrophin deficiency is present - Trial and maximize amblyopia therapy before considering strabismus surgery; defer surgery (often until school age) as appropriate - Prescribe polycarbonate safety spectacles to protect the better‑seeing eye
Patient Education: Explain optic nerve hypoplasia (small optic nerves) and that vision can range from near normal to severely reduced; discuss possible associated brain/pituitary problems (septo‑optic dysplasia) and need for endocrine testing and long‑term follow‑up. Reassure parents that some visual improvement may occur and that amblyopia therapy (patching/vision stimulation) can be tried if appropriate. Recommend neuroimaging and evaluation by an endocrinologist for hormone testing and replacement if needed. Advise regular developmental surveillance and coordination with the pediatrician/neurologist. Discuss eye protection for the better eye (polycarbonate lenses) and that strabismus surgery, if considered, is usually delayed until amblyopia treatment is optimized and school age. Emphasize signs that require urgent care (poor feeding, failure to gain weight, vomiting, lethargy, or signs of adrenal insufficiency) and provide instructions to seek immediate medical attention for these.
Referrals: Endocrinology (pediatric endocrinologist)
Emergency Instructions: Stress doses of corticosteroids should be administered in situations such as acute illness, surgery, or serious injury for patients with corticotrophin abnormalities.

Severity: Severe
Laterality: bilateral
Complications: undercorrection; overcorrection; asymmetric or unsatisfactory lid contour; lagophthalmos with exposure symptoms


Plan
All Procedures: External levator advancement on both upper eyelids
Patient Education: If ptosis is mild and not causing symptoms, observation is reasonable. Temporary measures include eyelid taping or eyelid crutches on glasses to improve vision. For symptomatic ptosis causing visual field impairment, discuss surgical options: anterior levator advancement (external approach to reattach/advance the levator and recreate the eyelid crease) or posterior Muller’s muscle procedure; risks include under- or overcorrection, asymmetry, contour abnormalities, and lagophthalmos/exposure. Explain that surgery is usually performed under local anesthesia with intraoperative adjustment, typically improves visual field, and requires follow-up to monitor healing and eyelid position.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Involutional ectropion of the left lower eyelid causing ocular irritation from poor punctal apposition and exposure-related corneal surface disease. Surgical correction with lateral tarsal strip and medial spindle was performed, resulting in improved eyelid position and symptom relief.
Primary Diagnosis: Involutional ectropion of the left lower eyelid with resultant ocular irritation
Differential Diagnosis: Involutional ectropion; Cicatricial ectropion; Paralytic ectropion; Mechanical ectropion
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Procedures: lateral tarsal strip procedure; medial spindle procedure
Follow-Up Instructions: Routine postoperative follow-up with the oculoplastics surgeon to assess wound healing and eyelid position; return for suture removal and exam within 1 week; continue lubricating drops/ointment as needed; seek prompt evaluation for increasing pain, redness, discharge, vision change, or wound dehiscence.
Patient Education: Involutional ectropion is caused by age‑related loosening of the eyelid support, which can make the lower lid turn outward and cause tearing, dryness, irritation, and corneal damage. Mild cases can be managed with frequent lubricating eye drops during the day and ointment at night to protect the cornea. If symptoms persist or worsen, surgery is the definitive treatment; procedures (e.g., lateral tarsal strip with possible medial spindle or skin graft if scarring is present) tighten the eyelid and restore punctal apposition. Protect your eyes from wind and dry environments, use prescribed lubricants as directed, avoid rubbing, and return promptly for follow‑up if vision changes, worsening redness, pain, increasing tearing, or inability to close the eyelid occur.

Patient Education: Explain trichiasis and its causes (misdirected lashes from entropion or distichiasis), why lashes rubbing the eye cause pain and corneal damage, and that treatment options include temporary measures (lubricating drops/ointment, epilation), office procedures (cryoablation, electrolysis, laser) and surgical correction of the entropion (wedge excision, lid-splitting, Wies procedure). Discuss expected recurrence risk and possible need for repeat treatments, explain postoperative care and eyelid hygiene for blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction (warm compresses, lid scrubs, topical lubricants), warning signs requiring prompt return (increasing pain, redness, vision change, discharge), and set expectations for follow-up to monitor for recurrence and treat as needed.


CASE 91 — Dacryocystitis
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: chronic irritation of the left eye worsening over the last 2 years
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 64-year-old woman with no prior ocular history presented with chronic left eye irritation worsening over the past 2 years. She reported tearing and symptoms related to entropion of the left lower eyelid with lashes rubbing the globe, along with associated mild inferior corneal punctate changes and conjunctival staining. Symptoms were longstanding and progressive, attributable to lid malposition and abnormal posterior lashes causing trichiasis; there was associated diffuse lid-margin thickening, telangiectasia, and scattered lash debris.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman presented with chronic irritation of the left eye worsening over the past 2 years. She had no prior ocular history. Examination revealed left lower eyelid entropion that could be easily returned to normal with gentle downward pressure. The tarsal conjunctiva showed mild erythema without cicatricial changes, the inferior fornix was deep without symblepharon, and eversion revealed a row of fine nonpigmented lashes posterior to the gray line contacting the globe. Mild inferior punctate corneal changes and rose bengal staining of the inferior bulbar conjunctiva were present in areas touched by the abnormal lashes. Diffuse lid margin thickening, fine telangiectatic vessels, and scattered debris including collarettes on lashes of all four lids were noted. Symptoms were attributed to both the entropion and the abnormal posterior lashes (distichiasis/trichiasis) with associated ocular surface irritation; coexisting eyelid margin disease/meibomian gland dysfunction was suspected. Additionally, dacryocystitis of the right side secondary to nasolacrimal duct disruption from prior nasal surgery was later diagnosed and treated.
Symptom Onset: 2 years
Symptom Duration: 2 years
Progression: Resolved after treatment with oral antibiotics and subsequent DCR with silicone tubing; good resolution of symptoms.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Narrowing or obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (e.g., prior nasal surgery) leading to lacrimal sac blockage and infection; warm compresses recommended (no specific external aggravators stated)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Dacryocystitis of the right eye secondary to nasolacrimal duct disruption from prior nasal surgery, presenting with acute infection that responded to oral antibiotics; planned/definitive treatment with dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) with silicone tubing placement, performed after resolution of inflammation, resulting in good resolution of epiphora.
Primary Diagnosis: Dacryocystitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Right nasolacrimal duct obstruction (post‑nasal surgery)
Differential Diagnosis: Dacryocystitis secondary to nasolacrimal duct obstruction; Chronic dacryostenosis with recurrent canaliculitis; Preseptal/orbital cellulitis (less likely); Lacrimal sac neoplasm (consider in recurrent/atypical cases)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: recurrent infection/epiphora; lacrimal sac abscess/pyocele; need for surgical intervention (dacryocystorhinostomy); potential spread to surrounding tissues (cellulitis)


Plan
All Medications: oral antibiotics antibiotic ophthalmic drops silicone tubing
All Procedures: oral antibiotics; aspiration of lacrimal sac abscess (if present); dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) with placement of silicone tubing; warm compresses (therapeutic procedure)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up with ENT and oncology for management of underlying midline disease; continue postoperative follow-up after dacryocystorhinostomy with silicone tubing for epiphora resolution.
Patient Education: - Explain that dacryocystitis is an infection of the tear (lacrimal) sac caused by a blockage in the nasolacrimal duct, which leads to tearing, redness, pain, and swelling near the inner corner of the eye. - Emphasize importance of completing prescribed antibiotics and contacting the clinic promptly if fever, increasing pain, spreading redness, or worsening swelling occur. - Instruct on frequent warm compresses to the affected area to reduce pain and promote drainage; teach how to apply (warm, clean cloth for 10–15 minutes several times daily). - Explain that topical antibiotic eye drops are usually of limited benefit for this condition. - Advise that if an abscess forms, drainage may be needed and cultures can help tailor antibiotics. - Discuss that definitive treatment to prevent recurrence is dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR); surgery is usually done after the acute infection resolves but may be performed sooner if medical therapy fails. - Review postoperative expectations if surgery planned: temporary silicone tubes may be placed, follow-up with ophthalmology and ENT is needed, and epiphora (tearing) typically improves after successful DCR. - Recommend routine eyelid hygiene if concurrent blepharitis/meibomian dysfunction is present, and use of artificial tears for surface irritation as needed. - Provide return precautions and contact information for urgent concerns.
Referrals: Otolaryngology (ENT) and oncology
Emergency Instructions: Apply warm compresses frequently to the inflamed site; seek urgent medical care for worsening pain, increased swelling, fever, drainage of pus, or vision changes.

Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: None reported


Plan
All Medications: methylprednisolone (IV, 250 mg every 6 hours); oral prednisone; ophthalmic antibiotic drop (unknown)
All Procedures: nasolacrimal irrigation; dacryocystography (discussed as a test option); dacryoscintigraphy (discussed as a test option); intravenous methylprednisolone administration; conversion to oral prednisone; orbital biopsy (not performed but indicated if no improvement); MRI (follow-up)
Follow-Up Instructions: Referred for systemic evaluation for collagen-vascular disease or lymphoma; slow taper of oral steroid therapy with outpatient follow-up and repeat MRI to rule out underlying neoplasm.
Patient Education: Idiopathic orbital inflammation is an inflammatory condition of the tissues around the eye that typically causes pain, redness and swelling but often responds rapidly to high‑dose corticosteroid treatment. Treatment plan: start high‑dose systemic steroids (often IV methylprednisolone followed by an oral prednisone taper) with close follow‑up to monitor response and side effects. Expect symptom improvement within 24–48 hours; if no clear improvement after ~48 hours, biopsy and additional testing may be needed to exclude infection or tumor. Additional evaluation: systemic workup for autoimmune diseases and lymphoma as indicated, and MRI to exclude an underlying neoplasm if signs persist or recur. Monitor vision, pain, intraocular pressure, blood glucose and other steroid side effects during therapy; report worsening vision, increasing pain, fever, new neurological symptoms or signs of infection immediately.
Referrals: Referred for systemic evaluation for collagen-vascular disease or lymphoma

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 63-year-old man with acute (2-day) left orbital inflammation characterized by pain, decreased vision (OS 20/400), a 2+ left RAPD, marked periorbital edema/erythema, 3 mm left proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, painful global motility restriction, 3+ conjunctival injection with diffuse chemosis, and diffuse choroidal/scleral thickening on exam and MRI. Findings were consistent with orbital cellulitis with a large subperiosteal orbital abscess and associated ethmoid sinusitis. Blood and intraoperative cultures were negative. Treated with surgical drainage and ethmoidectomy plus IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clindamycin) with marked clinical improvement and complete resolution of swelling and motility restriction on follow-up.
Primary Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis with associated sinusitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Poorly controlled hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Idiopathic orbital inflammation; Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis; Thyroid-related orbital inflammation (thyroid eye disease); Orbital abscess from sinusitis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Subperiosteal orbital abscess with decreased vision (relative afferent pupillary defect) and choroidal thickening; potential vision threat (optic nerve dysfunction) prior to drainage


Plan
All Medications: ceftriaxone; clindamycin
All Procedures: Drainage of large subperiosteal orbital abscess; ethmoidectomy; preoperative blood cultures; intraoperative cultures of purulent material.
Follow-Up Instructions: Marked improvement noted; after 48 hours IV antibiotics converted to oral antibiotics and patient discharged for outpatient follow‑up with subsequent examinations showing complete resolution of periorbital swelling and motility restriction.
Patient Education: Orbital cellulitis is a serious infection behind the eyelid that can cause eye pain, swelling, redness, decreased vision, and limited eye movement. It most often comes from nearby sinus infections or skin/eyelid trauma and requires prompt medical treatment to prevent vision loss or spreading infection. Key points and instructions: - You will need urgent treatment with intravenous antibiotics; sometimes surgery is required to drain an abscess. Follow hospital and surgeon recommendations closely. - Watch for worsening symptoms (increased pain, new or worsening vision loss, fever, spreading redness, or increased swelling) and seek emergency care immediately if they occur. - Complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if symptoms improve. - Keep the head elevated to reduce swelling and avoid activities that increase sinus pressure (heavy lifting, nose blowing) until cleared. - Attend all follow-up appointments so the eye, vision, and sinuses can be rechecked; additional imaging or ENT follow-up may be needed. - If you have or develop fever, diabetes, immune suppression, or recent trauma/sinus disease, inform your providers—these affect treatment decisions. - Ask your care team for clear discharge instructions about medications, wound care, signs to watch for, and when to return to work or normal activities.
Referrals: ENT surgeon; Infectious disease consult (pediatric infectious disease)


CASE 94 — Dacryoadenitis
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right-sided eyelid swelling, pain, and fever for 4 days
DURATION: 4 days
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "No definite complaint of decreased vision."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 7‑year‑old boy with 4 days of right eyelid swelling, pain, and fever; initially diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and started on oral antibiotics with progression over 2 days to complete right upper‑lid ptosis, worsening edema and erythema, lethargy, fever ~100°F, periorbital tenderness, conjunctival injection, decreased right eye motility in all directions, mild proptosis, and palpable preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy; no definite complaint of decreased vision.
History Narrative: A 7-year-old boy was referred for evaluation and treatment of right-sided eyelid swelling, pain, and fever. His symptoms began 4 days prior to presentation. No definite complaint of decreased vision was elicited. The presumptive diagnosis of preseptal cellulitis had been made, and the patient had been placed on oral antibiotics. Two days later, the child was reevaluated and found to have progression of the right upper lid edema, now causing a complete ptosis. Because of the disease progression despite oral antibiotics, the patient was referred to a tertiary care center. Upon his arrival, it was noted that the child was somewhat lethargic and continued to complain of pain around the right eye. The patient’s temperature was 100 °F. There was marked periorbital edema and erythema with complete ptosis of the eyelid. Enlarged preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes were palpated. The eyelid was gently lifted to allow for testing of the visual acuity, which was found to be 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. The conjunctiva appeared diffusely injected, and there was decreased motility of the right globe in all directions of gaze. No conjunctival discharge was noted. Mild proptosis of the globe appeared to be present; however, the diffuse lid edema and tenderness precluded formal exophthalmometry measurements. The pupils reacted normally with no relative afferent defect. The anterior segments were quiet, and the dilated fundus exam showed no significant abnormalities.
Symptom Onset: 4 days prior to presentation
Symptom Duration: 4 days
Progression: Progression of the right upper lid edema over 2 days despite oral antibiotics, now causing complete ptosis.
Characteristics: Acute inflammation and enlargement of the lacrimal gland (acute dacryoadenitis) characterized by rapid onset upper outer eyelid pain, fullness/“S-shaped” eyelid deformity, erythema and edema of temporal upper eyelid and conjunctiva, tenderness over superotemporal orbit, often with regional lymphadenopathy; in this case EBV-associated, self-limited, may respond to topical/oral corticosteroids.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 12-year-old boy with 1-week history of left upper eyelid swelling. Examination showed temporal fullness of the left upper lid with an S-shaped deformity, tenderness, enlargement and erythema of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, conjunctival injection and chemosis laterally, and mild regional lymphadenopathy. Ocular motility and intraocular exam otherwise normal. Imaging may show an enlarged lacrimal gland or orbital mass without bony erosion. Clinical presentation most consistent with an orbital dermoid cyst; surgical excision via lid crease approach performed with complete removal and good postoperative outcome.
Primary Diagnosis: Dermoid cyst of the right orbit
Differential Diagnosis: Lacrimal gland inflammation (dacryoadenitis); Dermoid/epidermoid cyst; Lacrimal gland tumor (pleomorphic adenoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma); Orbital cellulitis
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: inflammatory response from traumatic rupture of the dermoid cyst


Plan
All Procedures: Surgical removal (complete excision) of a dermoid cyst via lid crease incision
Patient Education: A dermoid cyst is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that commonly occurs near the eye in children. It is caused by trapped skin tissues and may slowly enlarge. Because it can rupture and cause inflammation or become cosmetically noticeable, surgical removal is generally recommended; surgery is often done through a lid-crease incision to minimize visible scarring. There is no effective medication to remove a dermoid cyst. Risks of surgery and anesthesia (discuss timing in infants) and possible complications such as infection, bleeding, scarring, or recurrence should be reviewed. Follow-up after surgery is important to monitor healing and vision; if you notice redness, increasing swelling, fever, new pain, or changes in vision, contact the clinic promptly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 44-year-old man with progressive, painless left-sided eyelid/orbital prominence and 4 mm relative proptosis OS. Examination: VA 20/20 OU, manifest refraction –2.25 D OD and +1.00 D OS, normal motility and pupils, widened left palpebral fissure, increased resistance to retropulsion OS, choroidal striae OS, otherwise normal anterior and dilated fundus exam. Orbital CT: well-circumscribed retrobulbar lesion with marginal contrast enhancement and no bony changes. Clinical and radiographic features consistent with a benign eyelid tumor, most likely intradermal nevus. Management: excisional biopsy of upper eyelid lesion performed; histopathology confirmed intradermal nevus. No further treatment indicated; patient doing well without recurrence.
Primary Diagnosis: Intradermal nevus
Differential Diagnosis: Intradermal nevus; seborrheic keratosis; squamous papilloma; hidrocystoma
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Procedures: Excisional biopsy of the upper eyelid lesion (office procedure under local anesthesia)
Follow-Up Instructions: The patient has done well without evidence of recurrence.
Patient Education: This lesion is a benign intradermal nevus of the eyelid. It grows slowly, is not cancerous, and often needs no treatment unless it causes symptoms or cosmetic concern. Options include observation with periodic checks or simple surgical excision under local anesthesia in the office; excision specimens are sent for pathology to confirm the diagnosis. If removed, healing is usually straightforward but care is taken to avoid eyelid margin distortion; report increasing redness, pain, drainage, vision changes, or signs of recurrence. Follow-up visits will monitor healing and check for recurrence.

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Within normal limits


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 32-year-old man with a slowly enlarging, smooth, amelanotic 10×8×5 mm dome-shaped lesion of the left upper eyelid (preseptal skin) without ulceration, telangiectasia, madarosis, or regional lymphadenopathy. Clinical differential favored benign nevus vs other benign epithelial or adnexal lesions, but high suspicion for basal cell carcinoma prompted excisional biopsy. Intraoperative frozen section confirmed nodular basal cell carcinoma with clear margins. Defect repaired with full-thickness skin graft; postoperative course satisfactory. Patient counseled regarding increased risk for new skin malignancies and placed under dermatologic surveillance.
Primary Diagnosis: Lesion of the right upper eyelid (medial canthal region); probable basal cell carcinoma
Differential Diagnosis: Intradermal nevus; Sebaceous (sweat gland) adnexal tumor (e.g., hidrocystoma, syringoma); Seborrheic keratosis; Basal cell carcinoma
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: None
All Procedures: Excisional biopsy of left upper eyelid lesion with intraoperative frozen section analysis confirming basal cell carcinoma and full-thickness skin graft repair of the defect (reconstruction).
Follow-Up Instructions: Educated about increased risk for new skin malignancies and ongoing dermatology surveillance; routine postoperative follow-up for surgical site monitoring and graft assessment.
Patient Education: He was educated about his increased risk for the development of new skin malignancies and advised to undergo continued dermatologic surveillance.
Referrals: Dermatology (for continued surveillance)
