CASE 01 — Acute Follicular Conjunctivitis
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Photophobia, right eye discomfort, and headache for 2 weeks
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I specifically deny any sexual contact."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 37-year-old female office worker with a 2-week history of photophobia, ocular discomfort, and right-sided headache; 1 week prior developed sudden onset redness and watering of the right eye on first day back at work after a vacation in Hawaii, noted swelling in front of the right ear; initially seen and treated with 2-week topical tobramycin–dexamethasone with transient node size decrease, then 2 days after stopping drops developed corneal epithelial infiltrates and persistent follicles; currently unilateral symptoms with mild ptosis, mild bulbar injection, moderate pretarsal follicles and papillae, right corneal midperipheral and some central epithelial infiltrates, visual acuity 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS.
History Narrative: A 37-year-old female office worker with a 2-week history of photophobia, ocular discomfort, and headache centered around her right eye. One week prior she developed sudden onset redness and watering of the right eye on the first day back at work after a vacation in Hawaii. She also noted swelling in front of her right ear. She saw an eye-care practitioner who found unilateral follicular conjunctivitis with a mildly tender preauricular node and treated her with topical tobramycin–dexamethasone drops for 2 weeks; the node became slightly smaller but 2 days after stopping the drops she developed epithelial corneal infiltrates and persisting follicles. She denies sexual contact and systemic/genital symptoms, had stayed in hotels and used swimming pool facilities on vacation, and has no known exposure to birds or cats. Visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. At examination there was a right-sided nontender preauricular node, 1–2 mm right upper lid ptosis, mild right bulbar conjunctival injection, moderate pretarsal follicles and papillae OD with fewer inferior fornix follicles OS, and diffuse midperipheral and a few central epithelial corneal infiltrates OD; left cornea and anterior segment were normal.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Progression: Improving
Characteristics: Acute follicular conjunctivitis with unilateral photophobia, discomfort, mild ptosis, preauricular lymphadenopathy, moderate pretarsal follicles and papillae, mild bulbar injection, and right corneal epithelial infiltrates (midperipheral and few central), likely adenoviral.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Use of topical corticosteroids early in the course (masked presentation; cessation led to epithelial infiltrates)
Alleviating Factors: Observation and symptomatic treatment with cool compresses and unpreserved lubricants
Associated Symptoms: Photophobia
Previous Episodes: No prior episodes reported
Prior Treatments: topical tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension drops (2-week course)
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild — some photophobia, discomfort, and headache affecting right-eye–centered activities (work/near tasks) but vision largely preserved (20/25) so daily activities mostly maintained with symptomatic limitations.
Systemic Symptoms: No systemic symptoms
Recent Travel: Hawaii
Risk Factors: Recent travel (vacation in Hawaii), use of hotel rooms and swimming pool facilities, prior topical corticosteroid use, possible fomite exposure (contact with contaminated surfaces)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, most consistent with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis given recent fomite/pool exposure, unilateral follicular conjunctivitis with preauricular lymphadenopathy, and corneal epithelial and subepithelial infiltrates; viral, HSV, and chlamydial testing were negative. Observation and supportive care recommended, with consideration of topical steroid (e.g., loteprednol) if visually significant subepithelial infiltrates persist, and follow-up in 4–6 weeks to monitor resolution and corneal scarring.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute follicular conjunctivitis, likely adenoviral
Differential Diagnosis: Adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis (epidemic keratoconjunctivitis or pharyngoconjunctival fever); Chlamydial (adult inclusion) conjunctivitis; Herpes simplex keratoconjunctivitis; Molluscum contagiosum-induced conjunctivitis
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: corneal epithelial infiltrates progressing to subepithelial infiltrates and potential corneal scarring (reduced visual acuity), conjunctival membranes/pseudomembranes with risk of symblepharon, prolonged viral shedding/infectivity

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling
DURATION: 15 months
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I was only using the prescription drops you listed."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 38-year-old woman, 15 months post-penetrating keratoplasty OD, presents for routine follow-up with comfortable eyes but 6-week history of right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling following a febrile illness; internist suspected “strep throat” or mononucleosis, throat culture and EBV serology negative, treated with oral penicillin for 14 days with resolution of systemic symptoms but persistent right preauricular lymphadenopathy; no ocular symptoms at onset; over preceding weeks developed mild right-sided ocular erythema and irritation with prominent inferior and superior tarsal follicles and mild keratoplasty epitheliopathy OD while on chronic topical medications (loteprednol, brimonidine, timolol gel, methylcellulose).
History Narrative: A 38-year-old female presents for routine follow-up 15 months after right penetrating keratoplasty and anterior segment reconstruction for trauma. She is otherwise healthy. Six weeks earlier she developed fever and swollen glands, particularly on the right side of her face; her internist suspected “strep throat” or mononucleosis. Throat culture and Epstein–Barr virus serology were negative. She was treated with oral penicillin for 14 days and recovered except for persistent right preauricular lymphadenopathy. She has no ocular symptoms from that illness but now complains of mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling. Past ocular history includes medically treated traumatic angle-recession glaucoma of the right eye and the prior penetrating keratoplasty; the left eye is normal. Current right eye medications: loteprednol etabonate 0.5% twice daily, brimonidine 0.2% twice daily, timolol gel-forming solution 0.5% twice daily, and methylcellulose at bedtime. She denies use of any other eye drops, over-the-counter, herbal, or home remedies, denies close contact with animals, and has not traveled to endemic areas. She is monogamous and denies gynecologic complaints. On prior visit 3 months earlier there was no ocular inflammation.

Differential Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis (adenovirus/EBV/HSV); Chlamydial (adult inclusion) conjunctivitis; Toxic (medicamentosa) follicular conjunctivitis from preserved topical glaucoma medications; Conjunctival lymphoma (masquerade syndrome)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: Progressive punctal stenosis; conjunctival scarring with symblepharon; obliteration of conjunctival fornices; superficial punctate keratopathy; large epithelial erosions and corneal ulceration/melting.


Plan
All Medications: loteprednol etabonate 0.5% twice daily; brimonidine 0.2% twice daily; timolol gel-forming solution 0.5% twice daily; methylcellulose (at bedtime); oral penicillin (14 days); azithromycin 1000 mg orally once; doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily (7–10 days); erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily (7–10 days); preservative-free artificial tears/ointment; topical corticosteroids; topical cyclosporine A 1%; topical tacrolimus ointment; trifluridine; idoxuridine; gentamicin; tobramycin; pilocarpine; apraclonidine; epinephrine; dipivefrin
All Procedures: Penicillin (oral) 14 days; Conjunctival scrapings for pathology; Viral cultures (HSV on human fibroblast cells; adenovirus); Chlamydia culture on McCoy cells; Conjunctival smear for direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining; Discontinuation of brimonidine (medication cessation); Preservation-free artificial tears/ointment (supportive therapy).
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up every 2–3 weeks until improvement is noted; discontinue offending agent (brimonidine) and use preservative-free lubrication; observe closely for occult infection and for signs of progression (conjunctival scarring, symblepharon, punctal stenosis).
Patient Education: Removal of the offending topical medication is the first and most important step. Switch to preservative‑free alternatives if the medication is still needed. Use preservative‑free artificial tears or ointment and cold compresses for comfort. Expect follow‑up every 2–3 weeks until improvement; seek prompt reassessment if symptoms worsen. Recognize that failure to stop the offending agent can lead to conjunctival scarring, symblepharon, punctal stenosis, and corneal complications.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis presenting with conjunctival injection, edema, 2+ palpebral papillary reaction, mucopurulent discharge causing eyelids to be stuck, and an inferior fornix fibrin–mucus pseudomembrane. Cornea clear, anterior chamber quiet, no afferent pupillary defect. Vision reduced OD to 20/30 with refraction; IOPs 18 OD, 15 OS. Gram stain showed numerous gram-positive cocci in pairs with many PMNs; cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae sensitive to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and TMP-SMX. Managed medically with topical trimethoprim–polymyxin B drops four times daily with significant improvement by 2 days.
Primary Diagnosis: Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial conjunctivitis with inflammatory pseudomembranes
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis (streptococcal); Viral conjunctivitis; Allergic conjunctivitis; Gonococcal (hyperacute) conjunctivitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Formation of inflammatory pseudomembranes - Potential corneal involvement (increased risk of corneal inflammation, ulceration, or perforation) - Spread to the fellow eye - Transmission to contacts


Plan
All Medications: metoprolol trimethoprim sulfate–polymyxin B (topical ophthalmic drops) penicillin ciprofloxacin vancomycin trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole bacitracin gentamicin besifloxacin ceftriaxone
All Procedures: Gram stain of conjunctival mucus; Conjunctival cultures plated on blood and chocolate agar; Removal (peeling) of inferior conjunctival pseudomembrane (performed/debrided)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up PRN if symptoms worsen or do not improve; otherwise return for re-evaluation if persistent discharge, increased pain, vision loss, or signs of corneal involvement.
Patient Education: - Use prescribed trimethoprim–polymyxin B eye drops four times daily for 7 days; complete the full course even if symptoms improve. - Apply warm compresses and use artificial tears for comfort as needed. - Avoid touching eyes, sharing towels/washcloths, or close contact while symptomatic to reduce spread. - Expect symptoms to improve within a few days; most cases resolve in 1–2 weeks. - Return sooner if vision worsens, eye pain increases, symptoms rapidly worsen, copious purulent discharge develops, or signs of corneal involvement occur.
Work Restrictions: Avoid touching eyes, avoid sharing towels or washcloths while symptomatic; may return to work when symptoms improve (typically after starting antibiotic therapy and discharge decreased).
Emergency Instructions: Seek urgent care if you develop severe eye pain, marked worsening of vision, intense redness or swelling, inability to open the eye, fever, or rapidly increasing purulent discharge—these may indicate hyperacute/gonococcal infection or corneal involvement requiring immediate evaluation and systemic therapy. If symptoms suddenly worsen or you cannot tolerate oral/eye meds, go to the emergency department.


CASE 04 — Pterygium
===================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 32-year-old lifeguard with intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation; visual acuity 20/20 OU; exam shows fibrovascular overgrowth of bulbar conjunctiva extending onto the cornea of both eyes (bilateral pterygia).
History Narrative: A 32-year-old lifeguard presents with intermittent symptoms of bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 32-year-old male lifeguard with bilateral nasal interpalpebral fibrovascular overgrowths of bulbar conjunctiva extending onto the cornea consistent with bilateral pterygia. Symptoms include intermittent bilateral redness, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation. Visual acuity 20/20 OU with no current visual axis involvement. Findings and history (young outdoor worker with UV exposure) support diagnosis of pterygium rather than pseudopterygium or malignancy; no atypical vascular pattern described. Management options: conservative therapy with frequent preservative-free artificial tears, UV protection, and topical NSAIDs or short course topical steroid for active inflammation (e.g., qid taper over 2–3 weeks) with monitoring of IOP if steroids used. Document horizontal/vertical dimensions and consider corneal topography if concerned about induced astigmatism or progression. Surgical excision indicated if progressive growth toward visual axis, induced astigmatism, unacceptable cosmesis, or refractory symptoms; discuss recurrence risk (up to 35–40% for primary, higher for fleshy lesions) and adjunctive measures (mitomycin C, extensive Tenon’s removal, conjunctival autograft or amniotic membrane ± fibrin glue) that can reduce recurrence to <5% but carry risks (mitomycin C: persistent epithelial defects, scleral necrosis). Plan: conservative management with lubrication and UV protection, short steroid course if inflammation persists, return for monitoring and measurement; consider surgical referral if progression, visual axis encroachment, or symptomatic worsening.
Primary Diagnosis: Pterygium, bilateral
Differential Diagnosis: Pinguecula; Pseudopterygium (conjunctival scar from trauma/chemical injury); Conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia/squamous cell carcinoma
Severity: Mild to moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Persistent epithelial defects; scleral necrosis; recurrence (35–40%, higher in fleshy/active lesions); restriction of extraocular motility; more aggressive growth in recurrent pterygia; complications from surgery (fibrovascular scarring)


Plan
All Medications: preservative-free artificial tears; topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication; topical steroid (e.g., mild topical steroid dosed four times daily, tapered over 2–3 weeks); mitomycin C (antimetabolite, 0.02% cited); topical antibiotic (postoperative, four times a day); topical corticosteroid (postoperative, tapered)
All Procedures: Observation/serial slit‑lamp measurements; topical preservative‑free artificial tears; topical NSAID; short course topical steroid (q.i.d. tapered over 2–3 weeks); ultraviolet‑blocking sunglasses. Surgical: pterygium excision (local subconjunctival anesthesia with lidocaine); removal of Tenon’s capsule; anterior lamellar dissection/corneal component excision; conjunctival autograft; conjunctival rotational flap; amniotic membrane transplantation; securing graft with sutures or fibrin glue; adjunctive mitomycin C (subconjunctival/topical) and/or irradiation. Postop topical antibiotic (q.i.d. until re‑epithelialization); postop topical corticosteroid with taper.
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up based on severity and proximity to visual axis; earlier follow-up if topical steroids are used (to assess response and monitor intraocular pressure).
Patient Education: A pterygium is a benign, fibrovascular growth of the conjunctiva often related to sun and wind exposure. If small and not affecting vision it can be observed and managed with frequent preservative‑free artificial tears for dryness and topical NSAIDs for mild symptoms. For inflamed or symptomatic lesions a short course of a mild topical steroid (e.g., QID, taper over 2–3 weeks) can control inflammation; protect against UV with sunglasses. Surgery is considered if the pterygium grows onto the visual axis, induces astigmatism, causes unacceptable cosmesis, or has severe symptoms; discuss recurrence risk (often up to 35–40%, lower with adjuncts) and postoperative care including topical antibiotic until re‑epithelialization and a tapered topical steroid. Seek prompt re‑evaluation for rapid growth, increased redness, vision changes, or pain.

==================================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden onset of unilateral eye pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision upon awakening
LATERALITY: Unilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I awoke from sleep with sudden onset of pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, light sensitivity, and blurred vision when I opened my eyes."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 35-year-old woman with sudden onset upon awakening of unilateral eye pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision; woke with symptoms and noted multiple prior similar spontaneous episodes in either eye; no history of ocular trauma; mother with similar episodes. Visual acuity 20/400 in affected eye. Slit-lamp showed a large discrete epithelial defect with heaped-up edges and fluorescein pooling; fellow eye had map-dot-fingerprint epithelial changes consistent with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy.
History Narrative: A 35-year-old woman awoke from sleep with sudden onset of unilateral pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening her eyes. The patient had a previous history of multiple similar episodes occurring in either eye. The patient’s mother has also been affected with similar episodes. She had no history of prior ocular trauma. Visual acuity is 20/400 in the involved eye and 20/20 in the fellow eye. Slit-lamp examination of the involved eye revealed a large, discrete area of epithelial sloughing. The edges of the epithelial defect were remarkable for a “heaped-up” appearance. No infiltrate was apparent. Fluorescein dye revealed pooling over the epithelial defect. Examination of the fellow eye was remarkable for diffuse, superficial gray-white opacities in a “map” and “dot” configuration.
Symptom Onset: Upon awakening / immediately upon opening her eyes
Symptom Duration: Immediate (sudden onset upon awakening)
Progression: Recurrent
Characteristics: Map lines, fingerprint lines, and dots; diffuse superficial gray-white corneal epithelial irregularities with heaped-up edges of epithelial defects and loose epithelium that can slough as large sheets; typically bilateral, autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance, female predominance, presents with sudden painful awakening episodes of recurrent erosions.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Awakening/opening eyes after sleep (mechanical eyelid traction)
Associated Symptoms: pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision
Previous Episodes: multiple similar episodes
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant—acute episodes cause severe pain, photophobia, tearing and blurred vision (visual acuity 20/400) that markedly limit activities such as reading, driving, and work until healing occurs.
Systemic Symptoms: None
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: Mother
Risk Factors: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome (history of prior recurrent erosions), epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (map‑dot‑fingerprint dystrophy), family history (autosomal dominant inheritance), female sex, age 35, bilateral involvement, no prior trauma (nontraumatic dystrophy-related)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome secondary to epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy, right eye with large epithelial defect; fellow eye with bilateral map‑dot‑fingerprint changes (family history positive).
Primary Diagnosis: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome, basement membrane dystrophy type
Secondary Diagnoses: Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (map‑dot‑fingerprint dystrophy)
Differential Diagnosis: Recurrent epithelial erosion due to epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy; Traumatic corneal abrasion with recurrent erosion; Other anterior corneal dystrophies (e.g., Meesmann, Reis–Bücklers)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left eye
Complications: Delayed corneal wound healing; refractive changes


Plan
All Medications: topical antibiotic ointment cycloplegia soft bandage contact lens (not a medication) self-retained amniotic membrane grafts (Prokera, AmbioDisk) (not medications) hypertonic solutions (5% sodium chloride drops and 5% sodium chloride ointment) nonpreserved artificial tears artificial tear ointment
All Procedures: epithelial debridement / scraping bandage contact lens placement self‑retained amniotic membrane graft (ProKera or AmbioDisk) pressure patching application of prophylactic topical antibiotic ointment cycloplegia anterior stromal micropuncture excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) corneal topography
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful follow‑up until the epithelial defect fully heals with vigilance for infectious keratitis. After healing: frequent lubrication with nonpreserved artificial tears 4–8×/day and bedtime ointment. Consider 5% sodium chloride drops during the day and 5% sodium chloride ointment at bedtime for ≥3 months to promote epithelial adherence. Corneal topography if visual irregularity or haze suspected.
Patient Education: - Explain that they have epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy causing recurrent corneal erosions, often waking with sudden pain, tearing, and blurred vision. - These episodes can occur spontaneously, may affect either eye, and sometimes run in families (autosomal dominant pattern). - Acute care aims to relieve pain and promote healing: topical antibiotic ointment, pressure patch or bandage contact lens or self‑retained amniotic membrane, and cycloplegia if needed. - Watch closely for signs of infection (increasing redness, severe pain, worsening vision, discharge) and seek urgent care if they occur. - After healing, maintain frequent lubrication with nonpreserved artificial tears (4–8×/day) and ointment at bedtime; consider 5% sodium chloride drops/day and ointment at night for several months to help epithelial adherence. - If erosions recur or vision is affected by scarring/irregular astigmatism, surgical options (epithelial debridement, anterior stromal micropuncture, or PTK) can reduce recurrences — discuss risks/benefits with your eye surgeon. - Expect follow‑up until the defect heals; corneal topography may be recommended if vision remains irregular.


CASE 06 — Fuchs’ Corneal Dystrophy
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: slowly progressive loss of vision (worse in left eye), worse upon awakening initially with morning blur
LATERALITY: OU
PATIENT QUOTES: "Initially, her vision was worse upon awakening and gradually cleared as the day went on; more recently, however, her vision remained poor throughout the day."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 60-year-old woman with slowly progressive vision loss, worse in left than right eye; initially vision worse on awakening with gradual clearing during the day, more recently vision remained poor throughout the day.
History Narrative: A 60-year-old woman presented with a history of slowly progressive loss of vision in the left greater than the right eye. Initially, her vision was worse upon awakening and gradually cleared as the day went on; more recently, however, her vision remained poor throughout the day. Examination revealed corrected visual acuities of 20/200 in the right eye and counting fingers at 4 feet in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in each eye. Slit-lamp examination of the cornea revealed central microcystic epithelial edema and stromal edema with folds in Descemet’s membrane in the left greater than the right eye. Corneal guttatae and endothelial pigmentation extended over the central portion of the cornea in both eyes. The anterior chamber was deep and quiet, and the iris was normal in both eyes. Moderate nuclear sclerotic cataracts were present bilaterally, and dilated fundus examination revealed normal posterior poles through a hazy view. B-scan ultrasonography of the posterior poles was unremarkable.
Symptom Onset: Slowly progressive; initially worse in morning with gradual clearing, more recently vision remained poor throughout the day — onset over years (chronic, progressive).
Symptom Duration: slowly progressive (long-standing), worse initially in mornings and more recently persistent throughout the day
Progression: Slowly progressive
Characteristics: Slowly progressive endothelial dystrophy causing central corneal guttata with progressive endothelial cell loss leading to morning-worse epithelial and stromal edema (microcystic changes, Descemet folds), decreased visual acuity, diurnal fluctuation, corneal thickening on pachymetry, pleomorphism/polymegathism on specular microscopy, and potential progression to bullous keratopathy and scarring.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Morning awakening/eyelid closure (worse vision upon awakening)
Alleviating Factors: Vision gradually cleared as the day went on; hypertonic NaCl drops/ointment and corneal dehydration (e.g., hair dryer) reduce morning blur.
Associated Symptoms: Worse vision upon awakening (morning blur/diurnal vision fluctuation), progressive decreased vision, episodes of sharp pain from ruptured epithelial bullae
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant — vision severely reduced (20/200 OD, CF OS) with morning worsening and pain episodes from bullae; daily activities (reading, driving) markedly impaired, likely dependent on better eye.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: Age (older age), female sex, family history/genetic predisposition (heritable endothelial dystrophy)

Plan
All Medications: Hypertonic sodium chloride (NaCl 5%) ophthalmic drops; hypertonic sodium chloride ointment (bedtime); topical antibiotic drops (postoperative); topical corticosteroid drops (postoperative); nonpreserved artificial tears; BSS plus (balanced salt solution) irrigation fluid; dispersive or viscoadaptive viscoelastic (for phacoemulsification).
All Procedures: NaCl 5% (hypertonic sodium chloride) drops; hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime; hair dryer corneal dehydration technique; Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK); Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK); penetrating keratoplasty (PKP); cataract extraction (phacoemulsification) with intraocular lens (IOL) placement; combined cataract extraction with endothelial transplant; use of dispersive or viscoadaptive viscoelastic during phacoemulsification; endocapsular and chop phacoemulsification techniques; BSS Plus irrigation; specular microscopy; ultrasonic pachymetry; B-scan ultrasonography; topical antibiotic drops; topical corticosteroid drops; ointments and nonpreserved artificial tears; selective suture lysis and running suture adjustment; glasses or rigid gas permeable contact lenses; astigmatic keratotomy, compression sutures, wedge resection, repeat PKP; LASIK (after suture removal and secure wound)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Postoperative topical antibiotic and corticosteroid drops as prescribed; discontinue antibiotics after epithelial re‑epithelialization and taper steroids slowly over 6–12 months. - Use ointments and/or nonpreserved artificial tears as needed to rehabilitate the ocular surface; minimize preserved drops to reduce surface toxicity. - After DSAEK/DMEK remain supine until the air bubble is absorbed to allow graft attachment. - For PKP manage postoperative astigmatism with selective suture lysis and/or running suture adjustment guided by topography; prescribe glasses or RGP contact lenses when appropriate. - If high residual astigmatism persists, consider astigmatic keratotomy, compression sutures, wedge resection, or repeat PKP; delay LASIK until all sutures removed and wound secure.


CASE 07 — Keratoconus
=====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: gradual decreased vision in his right eye over the past year
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I don’t see clearly."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 19-year-old man with a 1-year history of gradual decreased vision in the right eye; long-standing history of glasses and contact lens use for 9 years with recent change in prescription and new contacts that do not restore clear vision; vision was previously correctable to 20/20 until last year. Denies trauma, surgery, or recent eye infection. Wears contact lenses. Reports seasonal allergies; allergic to penicillin. No family history of eye disease.
History Narrative: A 19-year-old man presents with complaints of gradual decreased vision in his right eye over the past year. He has worn glasses and contacts for 9 years, and despite a recent change in his prescription and new contact lenses, he does not “see clearly.” He denies any trauma, surgery, or recent eye infection. He reports his vision in both eyes was clear as a child and young adult and until last year was correctable to 20/20. His past medical history is significant for seasonal allergies. He reports allergies to penicillin and uses acetaminophen occasionally. He denies any family history of eye disease. The patient is healthy with a negative review of systems. He is wearing contact lenses.
Symptom Onset: Over the past year
Symptom Duration: 1 year
Progression: Progressive (worsening over past year)
Characteristics: Noninflammatory central/paracentral corneal ectasia with progressive thinning, irregular astigmatism and inferior steepening (cone), Vogt’s striae, Fleischer ring (epithelial iron), decreased pachymetry (OD 450 µm, OS 480 µm), usually bilateral but asymmetric, presents in adolescence/young adulthood with progressive vision loss and poor spectacle correction but improved with rigid gas-permeable lenses.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Eye rubbing and atopy (seasonal allergies)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 19-year-old man with keratoconus of the right eye, presenting with progressive decreased vision OD over one year. Exam notable for asymmetric high irregular astigmatism (manifest refraction OD −2.00 −7.50 × 60, BCVA with contacts 20/50 OD), central corneal thinning (pachymetry 450 μm OD, 480 μm OS), Vogt’s striae and partial Fleischer ring OD, and inferior corneal steepening on topography. No corneal scarring or other anterior/posterior pathology. Vision improves to 20/30 OD with rigid gas-permeable lens. Diagnosis: keratoconus OD (mild, asymmetric bilateral disease), currently managed with RGP contact lens; will monitor for progression and consider corneal cross-linking or keratoplasty if progression or contact lens intolerance occurs.
Primary Diagnosis: Keratoconus
Secondary Diagnoses: Seasonal allergies; Penicillin allergy
Differential Diagnosis: Keratoconus; Pellucid marginal degeneration; Terrien’s marginal degeneration; Keratoglobus
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: - Hydrops - Irregular corneal astigmatism - Corneal scarring - Residual astigmatism after surgery - Myopia (postoperative) - Glaucoma (postoperative) - Cataract (postoperative) - Mydriasis (postoperative) - Graft rejection (after PKP)


Plan
All Medications: Acetaminophen
All Procedures: Rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting; corneal cross-linking (UV light/riboflavin); intracorneal ring segments (INTACS); deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK); penetrating keratoplasty (PKP)
Follow-Up Instructions: This patient has done well in a rigid gas permeable contact lens for the right eye; continue RGP lens wear with regular follow-up for monitoring and reassess the left eye for progression of keratoconus.
Patient Education: Keratoconus is a noninflammatory thinning and bulging of the cornea that causes irregular astigmatism and decreased vision. It is usually bilateral but often asymmetric and may be associated with allergies and eye rubbing. Early disease is often managed with glasses or rigid gas-permeable/scleral/specialty contact lenses to improve vision. Corneal cross-linking (UV light with riboflavin) can strengthen the cornea and slow progression. If vision cannot be corrected with contact lenses or if there is significant scarring/thinning, surgical options include intracorneal ring segments (INTACS), deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), or penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Regular follow-up with corneal topography and pachymetry is recommended to monitor progression. Avoid eye rubbing and manage allergies to reduce progression risk.

Patient Education: Stop contact lens wear immediately. You have a bacterial corneal ulcer that requires urgent, frequent topical antibiotic drops and close follow‑up; do not self‑treat or delay care. Expect pain, redness, light sensitivity, and reduced vision initially; these should improve over days with treatment but scarring and persistent vision loss are possible. Use prescribed medications exactly as directed (hourly initially), attend all follow‑up visits, and seek immediate care for worsening pain, sudden vision loss, increased redness, or eye discharge. Avoid topical steroids unless prescribed by your specialist. Once healed, discuss contact lens hygiene, overnight wear avoidance, and treatment of any eyelid or tear‑film problems to reduce recurrence risk.


CASE 09 — Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca—Dry Eye
============================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: ocular irritation in both eyes
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "burning, foreign body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, and redness, more in his right eye." "These symptoms were worse in the morning and also in the later part of the day, and made him unable to read or drive comfortably." "He still has preserved emotional lacrimation." "He stated that he slept on his stomach, preferring his right side."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus referred for second opinion for unstable ocular surface/dry eye, with bilateral ocular irritation worse in right eye. Symptoms: burning, foreign-body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, redness — worse in morning and later in day, impairing reading and driving; preserved emotional tearing. Sleeps on stomach favoring right side. Reduced blink rate. Reports symptoms more pronounced in activities requiring sustained visual attention.
History Narrative: A 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented with a chief complaint of bilateral ocular irritation, referred for a second opinion for presumed unstable ocular surface due to dry eye in his right eye. He reported burning, foreign body sensation, a sandy-gritty feeling, and redness, greater in the right eye. Symptoms were worse in the morning and later in the day, impairing his ability to read or drive comfortably. He had preserved emotional lacrimation. He sleeps on his stomach preferring his right side. On review, blink rate was reduced bilaterally. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. External exam showed no rosacea, no palpable preauricular nodes; lid position and relationship to the globe were normal but lid tension was loose/floppy (2+ OD, 1+ OS). Slit-lamp exam revealed normal meibomian secretions (clear, easily expressible), low tear meniscus height in upper and lower lids bilaterally, diffuse injection of tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva with a mixed papillary and follicular response. Ocular sensitivity was markedly reduced on Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometry. Tear breakup time was <2 seconds OU. Fluorescein showed superficial punctate staining; rose bengal staining was positive over the exposure zone, more prominent OD. IOPs were 15 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Fluorescein clearance testing demonstrated markedly delayed dye clearance and decreased tear secretion in both eyes. Lens and fundus exams were unremarkable.
Progression: Chronic with intermittent worsening
Characteristics: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) due to aqueous tear deficiency from diabetes‑induced neurotrophic keratitis, with delayed tear clearance from reduced blink rate and floppy eyelids; bilateral, worse OD, tear breakup time <2s, low tear meniscus (<0.2 mm), reduced corneal sensitivity, positive rose bengal and fluorescein staining, Schirmer near 0 mm, preserved emotional lacrimation.

All Procedures: fluorescein clearance test (FCT) Schirmer test Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometry slit‑lamp examination fluorescein staining and tear breakup time measurement rose bengal staining (and lissamine green staining) external examination (lid evaluation) punctal occlusion (punctal plugs, thermal cautery) thermal cautery for punctal occlusion punctal plug placement tarsorrhaphy Botox‑induced ptosis (botulinum toxin injection) conjunctival flap surgery repair of eyelid malposition (e.g., ectropion repair) meibomian gland expression/warm compresses thermal pulsation (e.g., LipiFlow) intense pulsed light therapy lid hygiene/massage placement of special contact lenses (scleral or bandage contact lenses) self‑retained amniotic membrane placement autologous serum eye drop preparation topical steroid administration topical cyclosporine administration oral tetracyclines or macrolides (systemic antibiotic therapy) pilocarpine or cevimeline (systemic parasympathomimetic therapy) application of ophthalmic gels/ointments and preservative‑free artificial tears Lacrisert insertion (ocular lubricant insert)
Follow-Up Instructions: Return for follow-up as needed; start preservative-free artificial tears frequently; consider ophthalmology follow-up for reassessment and potential punctal occlusion, topical anti-inflammatory therapy, and eyelid/blink rehabilitation.
Patient Education: Explain that your symptoms are from dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) due to decreased tear production from diabetic nerve damage and poor tear clearance from reduced blinking and floppy lids. Key self-care: - Use preservative‑free artificial tears frequently during the day; consider gels/ointment at bedtime. - Blink consciously often, especially when reading or using screens; take regular breaks. - Apply warm compresses and lid hygiene to support meibomian gland function. - Sleep position: avoid sleeping on your right side to reduce morning worsening. - Consider punctal plugs or ointment at night if drops aren’t enough (discuss risks/benefits with your doctor). - Control diabetes and report any vision change, increasing pain, or signs of infection immediately. Follow-up with your ophthalmologist for monitoring, possible anti‑inflammatory therapy (short course steroids or topical cyclosporine), and consideration of further treatments (autologous serum, specialty lenses, or punctal occlusion) if symptoms persist.


CASE 10 — Postsurgical Corneal Edema
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with 1-year history of progressively decreased vision in both eyes, worse at night, who underwent uncomplicated left cataract surgery and presented postoperatively with persistent blurred vision and diffuse central and temporal corneal edema noted on post-op day 1.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man with a 1-year history of bilateral decreased vision (worse at night) and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years presented for evaluation. He had no prior ocular history or family history of ocular/systemic disease. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/100 OS. Slit-lamp exam showed moderate nuclear sclerosis OU (OS greater than OD). IOPs were 12 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS. Fundus exam showed no diabetic retinopathy. Potential acuity testing showed 20/25 in each eye. He underwent uncomplicated temporal clear corneal phacoemulsification with posterior chamber acrylic IOL implantation in the left eye. On postoperative day 1 his vision was 20/100 with IOP 18 mm Hg and slit-lamp exam revealed diffuse central and temporal corneal edema around the incision; he complained of persistent blurred vision without major discomfort.
Symptom Onset: 1 year
Symptom Duration: 1 year
Progression: Resolved
Characteristics: Postsurgical corneal edema: diffuse central corneal edema and temporal incision-site edema, decreased vision (blur), minimal discomfort, onset immediate postoperative (day 1), resolved with topical steroids and hypertonic saline to 20/20.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 55‑year‑old man with well‑controlled diabetes underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsification with PCIOL implantation in the left eye and developed diffuse central and temporal postsurgical corneal edema with decreased vision to 20/100 on POD1. IOPs were within normal limits (18 mm Hg OD preop, 18 mm Hg postop OS day 1). Differential includes preexisting low endothelial cell density (confirmed by specular microscopy of the fellow eye), Fuchs/endothelial dystrophy, surgical endothelial trauma, toxicity, inflammation, or transient endothelial dysfunction. Specular microscopy of the fellow eye demonstrated low endothelial cell density without guttata, leading to diagnosis of postoperative corneal edema secondary to preexisting low endothelial cell density of undetermined etiology. Initial management with frequent topical corticosteroids and 5% sodium chloride resulted in complete resolution of edema and recovery of final BCVA to 20/20. Continued monitoring of corneal thickness and endothelial status recommended; consider endothelial keratoplasty if edema recurs or decompensation persists.
Primary Diagnosis: Postsurgical corneal edema
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus (well controlled)
Differential Diagnosis: Preexisting endothelial disease/Fuchs endothelial dystrophy; Surgical endothelial trauma (including Descemet detachment or prolonged phacoemulsification); Toxic endothelial injury (intraocular contaminants or preserved intracameral agents); Postoperative elevated IOP (including pupillary block)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% topical, 5% sodium chloride (hypertonic) solution/ointment, topical antiglaucoma medications (if IOP elevation), systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (if IOP elevation), preservative-free intracameral epinephrine (recommended), preservative-free lidocaine (recommended)
All Procedures: phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation (left eye)
Follow-Up Instructions: Topical corticosteroids and 5% sodium chloride solution four times daily for 1 week, then follow-up after resolution (or sooner if worsening symptoms) for assessment of corneal clarity and visual acuity.
Patient Education: Your corneal swelling after cataract surgery is usually temporary and often improves with treatment. The key points: - Cause: swelling (edema) can occur when the cornea’s inner cells (endothelium) are low in number or injured during surgery. - Treatments: we used strong topical steroid drops to reduce inflammation and a hypertonic (5% sodium chloride) solution to draw fluid out of the cornea. If eye pressure rises, glaucoma medicines may be used. A therapeutic soft contact lens can help comfort and vision if the surface is irregular. - Expected course: most postoperative edema clears over days to weeks; follow-up exams and pachymetry or specular microscopy may be done to monitor recovery. - If swelling persists or vision does not improve after 2–3 months, surgical options (endothelial procedures such as DSAEK or DMEK, or rarely penetrating keratoplasty) can restore vision. - When to seek care urgently: worsening vision, increasing pain, redness, discharge, or sudden eye pressure changes.


CASE 11 — Dellen
================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to filtering bleb (dellen) causing ocular irritation/concern two weeks after trabeculectomy
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with glaucoma status post multiple prior filtration procedures who developed elevated IOP on maximal medical therapy and underwent a repeat trabeculectomy with a flap at the 7 o’clock position (to avoid prior site), resulting in a moderately elevated filtering bleb from 5 to 8 o’clock; two weeks after surgery noted peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to the bleb with fluorescein pooling and a small area of epithelial cell loss.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man with a history of glaucoma requiring multiple filtration procedures in the right eye developed elevated intraocular pressure on maximal medical therapy and underwent a repeat trabeculectomy. To avoid the previous surgical site, the trabeculectomy flap was created at the 7 o’clock position, resulting in a moderately elevated filtering bleb extending from the 5 to 8 o’clock positions. Two weeks after surgery, peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to the filtering bleb was noted; fluorescein pooling revealed a small area of epithelial cell loss.
Symptom Onset: Two weeks after surgery
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Characteristics: Typically associated with: underlying dry eye or meibomian gland dysfunction; well‑circumscribed “saucerlike” area of peripheral corneal thinning with sloping edges; often adjacent to an obvious limbal elevation disrupting tear distribution; tear film disruption over the area on blinking; fluorescein may pool in the depression (epithelium usually intact unless chronic breakdown); area rapidly rehydrates and thickens with lubrication, often becoming mildly opacified.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Dry eye, meibomian gland dysfunction/blepharitis (lid disease), adjacent limbal elevations (e.g., filtering bleb, dermoid, conjunctival elevation/chemosis), poor tear distribution, tearing film disruption from blinking, prior conjunctival surgery, exposed sclera after perilimbal conjunctiva removal.
Alleviating Factors: Rehydration of the area (generous viscous lubricating agent such as 1% methylcellulose or ophthalmic ointment and patching for 15–30 minutes), preservative‑free artificial tears, bland ointment, punctal occlusion, oral doxycycline and vitamin C (for persistent thinning), bandage contact lens or self‑retained amniotic membrane graft, eyelid/meibomian treatments (warm compresses, gland massage), tarsorrhaphy or secured amniotic membrane graft in severe cases
Associated Symptoms: Desiccation of the corneal epithelium with localized corneal thinning; fluorescein pooling and small area of epithelial cell loss; signs of dry eye and possible meibomian gland dysfunction/blepharitis (ocular irritation)
Prior Treatments: multiple filtration procedures in the right eye; repeat trabeculectomy (trabeculectomy flap at 7 o'clock)
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild — may cause irritation and localized vision disturbance but typically not significantly limiting; manageable with lubrication and routine treatments.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: Filtering bleb (limbal elevation), dry eye, meibomian gland dysfunction/blepharitis (lid disease), prior conjunctival surgery (conjunctival elevation), exposure/desiccation from impaired tear distribution

Slit Lamp Exam Description: Moderately elevated filtering bleb extending from 5 to 8 o’clock with adjacent peripheral corneal thinning (saucerlike dellen) at the limbus in the right eye with fluorescein pooling in the peripheral corneal excavation and a small area of epithelial cell loss; epithelium otherwise often intact along base of the delle.


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Delle of the right cornea adjacent to a filtering bleb due to localized tear-film disruption/dry eye; peripheral corneal thinning with fluorescein pooling and small epithelial defect from desiccation related to elevated bleb.
Primary Diagnosis: Delle (peripheral corneal thinning) in right eye due to dry eye associated with a filtering bleb
Secondary Diagnoses: Glaucoma; Dry eye (dry eye syndrome); Meibomian gland dysfunction/blepharitis
Differential Diagnosis: Dellen; Peripheral ulcerative keratitis from autoimmune/inflammatory disease (e.g., Mooren’s ulcer, rheumatoid-related melting); Terrien’s marginal degeneration
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: corneal epithelial breakdown progressing to scarring and true noninfectious corneal ulcer (keratolysis); potential scleral thinning (scleral delle); risk of persistent thinning requiring amniotic membrane grafting or tarsorrhaphy


Plan
All Medications: preservative-free artificial tears; bland ophthalmic lubricating ointment; punctal occlusion (procedural, not a drug); 1% methylcellulose solution; oral doxycycline; vitamin C; bandage contact lens (device); topical fluorescein (diagnostic); LipiFlow (device/therapy)
All Procedures: Trabeculectomy (repeat trabeculectomy with flap at 7 o’clock)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe and treat long term for signs and symptoms of dry eye contributing to dellen formation; regular follow-up visits to monitor healing and adjust therapies (lubrication, lid hygiene, punctal occlusion, possible bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane) and to detect progression requiring surgical intervention.
Patient Education: A delle is a localized area of peripheral corneal thinning caused by poor tear coverage, often next to an elevated area (like a filtering bleb). It can cause irritation and, if severe, epithelial breakdown. Treatment focuses on improving lubrication and treating eyelid/oil gland problems: use preservative‑free artificial tears frequently, apply bland ophthalmic ointment at night, consider punctal occlusion if recommended, and perform warm compresses with gentle lid massage for meibomian gland dysfunction. If the area does not improve, your doctor may prescribe oral doxycycline and vitamin C, fit a bandage contact lens, place an amniotic membrane graft, or in rare cases perform a small surgical procedure (e.g., tarsorrhaphy). Seek prompt follow‑up if you notice increasing pain, redness, vision loss, or a growing area of thinning.

Differential Diagnosis: Epithelial graft rejection; Subepithelial graft rejection; Endothelial graft rejection; Suture-related infection/abscess
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: Broken suture with suture abscess; endothelial corneal graft rejection leading to stromal edema, keratic precipitates, anterior chamber inflammation, risk of graft failure and need for repeat PK or DSAEK.


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (topical), scopolamine 0.25% (topical), prednisone (oral; e.g., 80 mg daily), triamcinolone (subconjunctival/transseptal; e.g., 40 mg/mL), Polytrim (topical), bacitracin ointment, ciprofloxacin (topical), fluoroquinolone topical antibiotics (e.g., fortified ciprofloxacin), cyclosporin A (systemic)
All Procedures: penetrating keratoplasty (PK); broken suture removal at the slit lamp; corneal suturing management (suture removal/lysis); topical antibiotic/antibiotic ointment administration (e.g., Polytrim, bacitracin, topical fluoroquinolone); topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone acetate 1%); cycloplegic agent administration (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%); systemic corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone); subconjunctival/transseptal steroid injection (e.g., triamcinolone 40 mg/mL); repeat penetrating keratoplasty; Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK); culturing of suture abscess; perioperative prophylactic systemic steroids or cyclosporin A
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up every 2–4 days for severe rejection or about 1 week for less severe episodes; decrease visit frequency as rejection comes under control and topical steroids are tapered; then return attention to visual rehabilitation (suture lysis, glasses, or rigid contact lens fitting as appropriate).
Patient Education: Seek care within 24 hours for any new redness, photophobia, foreign body sensation, or decreased vision; understand that broken sutures must be removed promptly to avoid infection, vascularization, or rejection; expect urgent slit‑lamp evaluation and aggressive topical steroid treatment for graft rejection; use prescribed topical antibiotics for suture removal or abscess per instructions and withhold or reduce steroids until infection is controlled; report worsening symptoms during treatment; attend frequent follow‑up visits (every 2–7 days initially) until rejection is controlled; discuss longer‑term visual rehabilitation options (suture adjustment, glasses, rigid contact lens) once inflammation resolves.
Emergency Instructions: Seek evaluation within 24 hours of any new photophobia, foreign body sensation, red eye, or decreased vision.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 42-year-old woman with a 2-year history of intermittent, now worsening bilateral eyelid itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and morning crusting. No contact lens wear or systemic disease reported. Exam: 20/20 OU, normal IOPs. Mild eyelid margin erythema with scaling and crusting at lash bases, evidence of trichiasis, madarosis, poliosis, and focal lid ulceration. Mild conjunctival hyperemia with inferior tarsal papillary reaction. Diminished tear lake OU. Rose bengal: inferior superficial punctate epithelial erosions. Schirmer test: mild aqueous tear deficiency OU. Findings most consistent with anterior blepharitis, staphylococcal type, with associated mild ocular surface disease/aqueous-deficient dry eye and early meibomian dysfunction features. Recommend eyelid hygiene/lid scrubs, warm compresses, preservative-free artificial tears q4–8h, consider topical antibiotic ointment at bedtime for staphylococcal control, short pulse topical steroid if significant inflammation, and follow-up in 3–6 weeks or sooner if steroids initiated. Consider culture if refractory or unilateral disease and evaluate for meibomian gland therapies (e.g., LipiFlow) or oral tetracyclines if persistent meibomitis.

Secondary Diagnoses: Aqueous tear deficiency; Mild conjunctival hyperemia; Papillary conjunctival reaction; Inferior superficial punctate epithelial erosions; Meibomian gland dysfunction (associated signs)
Differential Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis; Dry eye syndrome (aqueous tear deficiency); Giant papillary conjunctivitis; Demodex/pediculosis or infectious anterior blepharitis (staphylococcal/seborrheic/meibomian gland dysfunction)
Severity: Mild to Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Chronic, relapsing eyelid inflammation with structural damage (madarosis, trichiasis, lid ulceration, loss of lid architecture) - Keratitis including marginal infiltrates, phlyctenules, corneal infiltrates, neovascularization, thinning, and possible scarring - Aqueous tear deficiency / dry eye disease and associated punctate epithelial erosions - Recurrent chalazia and potential need for surgical correction of eyelid/eyelash malposition - Secondary infection and bacterial colonization (including MRSA) - Rarely missed eyelid malignancy (sebaceous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma)


Plan
All Medications: hypochlorous acid 0.01% (lid cleansing solution) erythromycin ophthalmic ointment sulfacetamide ophthalmic ointment bacitracin ophthalmic ointment topical steroids (short-pulse) preservative‑free artificial tears oral omega‑3 fatty acid (DHA/EPA) 1–3 g/day topical azithromycin ophthalmic solution oral minocycline oral doxycycline 50–100 mg twice daily oral tetracycline 250 mg four times daily
All Procedures: Eyelid hygiene/lid scrubs (mechanical debridement with cotton‑tip applicator or mild shampoo); application of topical antibiotic ointment (erythromycin, sulfacetamide, bacitracin); eyelid cultures and sensitivity testing; brief course topical steroids; preservative‑free artificial tears (q4–8h); warm compresses and eyelid massage (meibomian expression); oral omega‑3 supplementation; topical azithromycin ophthalmic solution; oral tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline) or oral minocycline; LipiFlow thermal pulsation; intense pulsed light; eyelid biopsy; surgical correction of eyelid/eyelash malposition.
Follow-Up Instructions: Initial follow-up in 3–6 weeks for moderate–severe disease (earlier if topical steroids prescribed); mild cases as needed/routine visit. Emphasize chronic relapsing nature and maintenance regimen (daily eyelid hygiene, warm compresses, artificial tears) and tailor regimen to symptom severity.
Patient Education: Blepharitis is a chronic, relapsing eyelid inflammation that requires ongoing eyelid hygiene and symptom control. Perform daily eyelid cleaning with warm compresses and gentle lid scrubs (cotton-tip or mild shampoo) to soften and remove crusts; avoid vigorous rubbing. Use preservative‑free artificial tears 4–8×/day for associated dry eye. Consider nightly topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) if severe crusting. Short courses of topical steroid drops/ointment may be used for severe inflammation under close follow‑up. Oral doxycycline or other tetracyclines or topical azithromycin may be recommended for refractory meibomian gland dysfunction (avoid tetracyclines in pregnancy/children). Maintenance therapy is often indefinite; expect relapses and return for follow‑up in 3–6 weeks (sooner if on steroids) or sooner for worsening, unilateral, or atypical signs (which may require biopsy to rule out malignancy).

Plan
All Medications: Viscoat, Provisc, Healon 5, topical prednisolone acetate, ofloxacin, diclofenac, timolol, brimonidine, prostaglandin analog (avoided), carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (avoided)
All Procedures: - Paracentesis and clear corneal incision (with 16-mm Fine/Thornton ring fixation) - Side-port incision - Viscoelastic anterior chamber fill (Viscoat, Provisc, Healon 5) - Blunt and viscodissection to lyse posterior synechiae - Insertion of Morcher iris-expander ring (iris expansion) - Continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis - Insertion of Morcher capsular tension ring - Cortical cleaving hydrodissection and hydrodelineation - Phacoemulsification using chopper technique (choo-choo chop and flip phacoemulsification) - Irrigation and aspiration of cortex - Injection of foldable silicone intraocular lens into capsular bag (6 D) - Main wound suturing - Paracentesis and split-port anterior vitrectomy - Removal of iris-expander ring - Removal of residual viscoelastic with vitrector - Stromal hydration to seal wounds
Follow-Up Instructions: Topical prednisolone acetate, ofloxacin, and diclofenac TID; closely monitor IOP—exam twice daily for 3 days; start prophylactic timolol and brimonidine to control IOP (avoid prostaglandin analogs and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors); routine postoperative visits with IOP checks and vision assessment (week 1 and ongoing follow-up).
Patient Education: - Explain diagnosis: nearly mature cataract, weakened zonules, atrophic iris, and history of glaucoma with a functioning filtering bleb; emphasize monocular status (other eye is blind). - Describe surgery planned: cataract extraction with protective measures — iris-expander ring, capsular tension ring, careful phacoemulsification technique, possible anterior vitrectomy — and goals (restore vision, avoid dropped lens, protect bleb and cornea). - Review risks specific to her case: intraoperative extension of iris tears, zonular failure with vitreous prolapse, corneal decompensation, IOP spikes, infection, and need for additional procedures. - Explain postoperative course and medications: topical steroid, antibiotic, and NSAID drops (prednisolone acetate, ofloxacin, diclofenac) with close IOP monitoring; possible temporary glaucoma drops (timolol/brimonidine) and avoidance of prostaglandin and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors initially. - Postop precautions: avoid heavy lifting/straining, keep eye clean and avoid water exposure, use eye shield as instructed, and do not rub the eye. - Follow-up plan: frequent checks early (twice daily for first 3 days as needed), early IOP checks, suture removal/healing assessments, refractive evaluation and visual rehabilitation at 1 week and subsequent visits. - When to seek immediate care: sudden vision loss, severe pain, increasing redness, discharge, flashes/floaters, or signs of infection. - Reassurance and expectations: likely significant visual improvement (example 20/80 by week 1) but possible need for additional treatments; long-term IOP control will be monitored.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Lens particle glaucoma of the left eye secondary to retained crystalline lens fragments after complicated cataract extraction. Presentation notable for decreased vision, redness, pain for 2 months, VA 20/400 OS, IOP 38 mm Hg OS, 2+ AC cell and flare, iridodonesis, ectopia lentis with prolapsed vitreous, and fluffy lens fragments visualized inferiorly on gonioscopy and subluxated lens in anterior vitreous on dilated exam. Differential considerations (angle-closure, phacolytic, phacoantigenic, infectious/ HLA-B27-associated iridocyclitis, angle-recession glaucoma) were considered and less likely based on open angle, absence of milky aqueous or granulomatous KPs, timing, and exam findings. Initial medical therapy included multiple topical IOP-lowering agents (timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine), topical atropine, and frequent topical corticosteroid (prednisolone acetate). Given persistent elevated IOP and need for IOL placement, patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy, lensectomy, and IOL placement 4 days after presentation. Postoperatively IOP normalized to 12 mm Hg without medications and final uncorrected VA improved to 20/30 OS.
Primary Diagnosis: Lens particle glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Lens particle glaucoma; Ectopia lentis; Prolapsed vitreous; Posterior vitreous detachment; Ocular hypertension; Inflammation (anterior uveitis)
Differential Diagnosis: Angle-closure glaucoma; Phacolytic glaucoma; Phacoantigenic (phacoantigenic) glaucoma; Iridocyclitis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: glaucoma (lens particle glaucoma), inflammation (uveitis/iritis), vitreous prolapse, retinal detachment (risk), cystoid macular edema, chronic inflammation, disabling visual floaters


Plan
All Medications: timolol; dorzolamide; brimonidine; atropine; prednisolone acetate; topical beta-blocker; alpha-2-adrenergic agonist; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; hyperosmotic agents (isosorbide, mannitol); corticosteroids (topical, periocular or systemic); prostaglandin analogs (not used)
All Procedures: pars plana vitrectomy; lensectomy; intraocular lens placement
Patient Education: Explain that retained lens material after cataract surgery can cause inflammation and high eye pressure (lens particle glaucoma), which may cause pain, redness, and vision loss; urgent treatment aims to reduce pressure and inflammation with eye drops (pressure-lowering agents, frequent steroid drops, and cycloplegic drops) and sometimes oral medication. Gonioscopy and close follow-up are needed. If medical therapy fails or there is vitreous prolapse, persistent inflammation, retinal detachment, or uncontrolled pressure, pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy (and possible IOL placement) is recommended—timing is individualized but often performed urgently if severe or within weeks to reduce risk of complications. Discuss possible risks and benefits of surgery (infection, bleeding, retinal detachment, need for further procedures) and expected recovery (improvement in pressure and vision possible, postoperative drops and follow-up visits). Instruct to seek immediate care for worsening pain, redness, sudden vision loss, flashes/floaters, or a dramatic rise in eye pressure.

History Narrative: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the eye clinic after intraocular surgery in the right eye, with a chief complaint of photophobia. Five days earlier, she had undergone combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye. Her left eye had undergone the same procedures 1 month prior to presentation. Her past medical history was significant only for hypertension. Her ocular medications were prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours and ofloxacin four times a day in both eyes.
Symptom Onset: 5 days after surgery
Symptom Duration: 5 days
Progression: Resolved with medical therapy; acute postoperative fibrinous uveitis occurring 2–14 days after surgery, presented on postoperative day 5 and improved with intensified topical steroids (no surgery required)
Characteristics: Fibrin deposition on IOL occurring 2–14 days postoperatively; presents with decreased vision, redness, pain, photophobia; slit‑lamp: cellular AC reaction (moderate cells and flare) without hypopyon; meshwork of fibrin strands/membrane on IOL/pupillary plane; may lead to posterior synechiae, IOL membrane/dislocation, secondary glaucoma, cystoid macular edema; immune‑mediated due to blood–aqueous barrier breakdown.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: surgical manipulation of the iris; incomplete removal of lens cortex/epithelial cells; intraoperative use of long-acting miotic agents (leading to posterior synechiae); prior recent intraocular surgery; diabetes; hypertension; pseudoexfoliation syndrome; uveitis; prolonged surgery
Alleviating Factors: Topical steroids (eg, prednisolone acetate) and intracameral tPA; reduction of inflammation/restoration of blood–aqueous barrier with medical therapy (may improve with time)
Associated Symptoms: photophobia, decreased vision, red eye, pain
Prior Treatments: prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours and ofloxacin four times a day in both eyes
Impact on Daily Activities: Decreased vision and photophobia limiting visual tasks; likely mild–moderate impairment of daily activities (e.g., reading, driving) OD for several days postoperatively
Risk Factors: Diabetes, hypertension, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, uveitis, prolonged surgery, previous intraocular surgery (including recent fellow-eye surgery), surgical manipulation of the iris, incomplete removal of lens cortex/epithelial cells, intraoperative use of long-acting miotic agent, prior history of intraocular surgery

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Postoperative fibrin deposition on the intraocular lens with moderate anterior chamber cells and flare five days after combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL implantation and trabeculectomy. No hypopyon; cornea clear; mild conjunctival injection and low bleb. Left eye: low bleb, clear cornea, rare anterior chamber cells, IOL well positioned. Dilated fundus exam notable for moderate (OD) and severe (OS) glaucomatous optic nerve cupping. Vision 20/60 OD, 20/200 OS (left poor from advanced glaucoma). Endophthalmitis less likely given timing and absence of severe pain, hypopyon, chemosis, or vitritis, but should be considered if symptoms worsen. Plan: intensify topical corticosteroid (prednisolone acetate), consider intracameral tPA if fibrin persists or is visually significant; monitor IOP and signs of infection, and follow closely.
Primary Diagnosis: Postoperative fibrin deposition on the intraocular lens (right eye)
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Postoperative fibrinous anterior uveitis (fibrin deposition on IOL); Acute postoperative endophthalmitis; Recurrent or chronic anterior uveitis (exacerbation after surgery)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: AC turbidity; corneal edema; elevated intraocular pressure; bleeding; corneal toxicity; band keratopathy; endophthalmitis; posterior synechiae; loss of iris function; membrane formation on the IOL; IOL dislocation; glaucoma; cystoid macular edema; posterior capsular opacification; infectious keratitis


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (topical) every 2 hours (patient's regimen) and ofloxacin (topical) four times a day.
All Procedures: combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (right eye); same procedures in left eye one month prior; intracameral tPA injection (as a treatment option); anterior chamber washout with fibrin membranectomy (as a possible later procedure); removal of IOL (if IOL-caused inflammation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Eye examinations at regular intervals to monitor visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and signs of infection or recurrent inflammation.
Patient Education: You developed an inflammatory reaction after eye surgery that caused fibrin (a protein) to deposit on the intraocular lens, which can blur vision, cause redness, pain, and light sensitivity. This usually happens 2–14 days after surgery and is not the same as an infection (endophthalmitis), though infection must be ruled out if symptoms are severe (worse pain, very poor vision, pus/hypopyon, marked redness or chemosis). What to expect and do now - Treatment: intensive topical steroid drops (e.g., prednisolone acetate) to reduce inflammation; follow the prescribed dosing exactly. In severe cases a one-time injection of medication (tPA) into the eye or oral/systemic steroids may be needed. - Symptoms that need urgent attention: rapidly worsening vision, increasing pain, severe redness, discharge, or new floaters — these could signal infection and require immediate evaluation. - Follow-up: return for scheduled visits so your doctor can monitor vision, eye pressure, and inflammation; more frequent visits may be needed initially. - Risks/complications to watch for: high eye pressure, recurrent inflammation, cataract/IOL problems, cystoid macular edema, or steroid-related infections of the cornea. Report any new symptoms promptly. - Prevention/long term: pre- or intraoperative anti-inflammatory measures reduce risk; adherence to postoperative drops and appointments lowers the chance of complications.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) of the left eye secondary to Marfan syndrome with superior lens subluxation and extensive inferior zonular dialysis (~6 clock hours); subtle inferior zonular dialysis in the right eye. Visual acuity 20/70 OS with myopic shift (–5.00 D), 20/20 OD (–0.75 D). No phacodonesis, no vitreous prolapse, IOP and fundus exam normal. Conservative management possible but surgical options (phacoemulsification with capsular support devices or pars plana lensectomy/vitrectomy depending on zonular stability) should be considered given symptomatic visual disturbance and glare; systemic evaluation (echocardiography) and family screening recommended for Marfan-related cardiac risks.
Primary Diagnosis: Lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) associated with Marfan’s syndrome
Secondary Diagnoses: Marfan’s syndrome
Differential Diagnosis: Marfan syndrome (hereditary ectopia lentis); Homocystinuria; Trauma-induced zonular dialysis; Pseudoexfoliation syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: No complications reported


Plan
All Procedures: Dilated examination; Gonioscopy; Peripheral retinal exam; Echocardiography (recommended); Spectacles or contact lenses; Amblyopia therapy (if pediatric); Cycloplegics; Miotics; Nd:YAG laser zonulysis; Peripheral laser iridotomy; Repositioning of prolapsed lens (manual/positional) with pharmacologic miosis; Phacoemulsification with capsulorhexis; Use of capsule retractors; Capsular tension ring (CTR) implantation (including Cionni or Malyugin modified CTR); Ahmed capsular tension segment placement and scleral suture fixation; Three-piece foldable IOL implantation (in the bag or sulcus with optic-capsulorhexis capture); Scleral or iris suture fixation of posterior chamber IOL; Intrascleral haptic fixation (glued IOL); Anterior chamber IOL implantation; Iris-claw IOL implantation; Pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy; Thorough peripheral vitrectomy; Secondary IOL implantation (delayed)
Follow-Up Instructions: Return for ophthalmology follow-up for monitoring and timing to be individualized; perform dilated exam and IOP check; monitor for progression of subluxation, phacodonesis, vitreous prolapse, retinal detachment; arrange echocardiography for Marfan cardiac evaluation; prompt surgical referral if vision declines, glaucoma, pupillary block, corneal endothelial compromise, or progressive lens subluxation.
Patient Education: Your lens (natural crystalline lens) is partially dislocated (subluxated) because of weak or broken zonules related to Marfan’s syndrome. This can cause blurry vision, glare, and a shift toward nearsightedness in the affected eye. Important points and next steps: - Systemic: Marfan’s can affect the heart and aorta. You should have echocardiography and cardiology follow-up to screen for valve disease or aortic dilation, because these can be life‑threatening if not monitored/treated. - Eye monitoring: Regular eye exams are needed for vision, intraocular pressure, and retinal checks (higher risk of retinal detachment). Report sudden vision loss, flashes, many new floaters, severe pain, or sudden worsening of vision immediately. - Non‑surgical options: Glasses or contact lenses may correct the refractive changes; miotic or cycloplegic drops can sometimes reduce symptoms. Patching or amblyopia treatment is relevant in children. - When surgery is considered: If vision or complications (pupil block, corneal contact, progressive lens displacement, glaucoma, or intolerance of corrective lenses) occur, surgery may be recommended. Options include lens-preserving cataract surgery with devices to support the capsule, or removal of the lens with vitrectomy and placement of an intraocular lens using various fixation methods. Your surgeon will choose the safest approach based on how loose the zonules are. - Risks of eye surgery: Possible complications include worsening zonular loss, capsule rupture, vitreous loss, retinal detachment, infection, bleeding, and need for further surgery. Long‑term IOL fixation methods each have advantages and risks that will be discussed. - Family/genetic: Because Marfan’s is often inherited, family members may benefit from medical and eye evaluation and genetic counseling. - Lifestyle/safety: Avoid eye trauma; wear protective eyewear during sports or activities. Keep regular follow‑up appointments. If you have questions about symptoms, surgery options, or need referral for cardiology/genetic evaluation, ask your ophthalmologist.

CASE 18 — Congenital Cataract
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: White pupils noted by pediatrician (bilateral leukocoria)
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 10-day-old infant noted by pediatrician to have bilateral white pupils (leukocoria); mother had uncomplicated term pregnancy with no rash or febrile illness; no family history of congenital/childhood cataracts. On exam poor wince to light OU, reactive pupils, normal EOMs, soft globes, clear normal-diameter corneas, central bilateral white lens opacities with no view to posterior segment; B-scan showed no retinal detachment or mass.
History Narrative: A pediatrician noticed white pupils in a 10‑day‑old infant and diagnosed bilateral cataracts. The infant was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy; the mother had no rash or febrile illness and maternal serologies were negative. There was no family history of congenital or childhood cataracts. On exam the infant had poor wince to light in both eyes, reactive pupils without a relative afferent pupillary defect, normal extraocular movements, soft globes to palpation, normal eyelids and conjunctiva, clear corneas of normal diameter, and central white lens opacities in both eyes with no view of the posterior segment. B‑scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Laboratory testing and genetic consultation failed to reveal an underlying genetic syndrome.
Symptom Onset: 10 days of age
Symptom Duration: 10 days
Characteristics: Bilateral central nuclear white opacities causing leukocoria, dense enough to obscure posterior view, present at 10 days of age with poor wince to light, reactive pupils, clear corneas, normal globe size, soft globes, no retinal detachment on B‑scan, idiopathic congenital nuclear cataracts.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: leukocoria, poor wince to light (decreased visual responsiveness), reactive pupils without RAPD, normal extraocular movements, soft globes to palpation

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Bilateral idiopathic congenital nuclear cataracts in a full‑term 10‑day‑old infant causing poor visual response; pupils reactive without RAPD, clear corneas, normal globe size, no view of the posterior segment with B‑scan negative for RD or mass; laboratory testing and genetic consultation unrevealing for systemic or syndromic etiology. Continuous monitoring for amblyopia and glaucoma recommended; surgical extraction indicated within recommended timeframe (bilateral removal by ~10 weeks) with postoperative refractive rehabilitation and close long‑term follow‑up.
Primary Diagnosis: Bilateral idiopathic congenital cataract
Differential Diagnosis: Retinoblastoma; Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV); Retinal detachment; Coats’ disease
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Posterior capsular opacification; secondary membrane formation/capsule opacification; glaucoma (≈20% risk, higher if surgery <4 weeks); retinal detachment (rare, usually late)


Plan
All Medications: atropine
All Procedures: B-scan ultrasonography; Ophthalmoscopy with dilated pupils; Laboratory testing (blood and urine for TORCH, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, amino acids, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase/galactokinase); Genetic consultation; Ophthalmic ultrasound; Examination under anesthesia (planned with intraocular pressure measurement and confirmation of findings); Cataract extraction (bilateral) with posterior capsulectomy/capsulotomy; Postoperative optical correction (aphakic spectacles—glasses)
Follow-Up Instructions: Excellent refractive correction immediately after surgery (contact lens for unilateral, spectacles for bilateral) with power biased for near/myopic, plus aggressive amblyopia therapy/occlusion as indicated; monitor for and manage postoperative inflammation and posterior capsule opacification; regular long‑term follow‑up including intraocular pressure checks for glaucoma (may present years later) and refractive adjustments.
Patient Education: Your baby has congenital cataracts—clouding of the lenses present at birth—which can block visual development and cause amblyopia if not treated early. Key points for parents: - Importance of early treatment: surgery is often recommended within weeks to months (unilateral by ~4–6 weeks; bilateral by ~10 weeks) to reduce risk of permanent vision loss. - Tests and workup: blood/urine testing and genetic evaluation may be done to look for infections, metabolic disorders, or syndromes; ocular ultrasound or exam under anesthesia may be needed if the back of the eye cannot be seen. - What surgery involves: removal of the cloudy lens; intraocular lens implantation is usually delayed until after infancy because the eye is still growing and implants can increase inflammation. Posterior capsule removal is commonly performed to prevent re‑clouding. - Postoperative care: prompt optical correction is essential—contact lenses for unilateral cases, glasses for bilateral cases (often set for near); frequent follow-up visits; patching/occlusion therapy as prescribed to prevent amblyopia. - Possible complications to watch for: posterior capsular opacification, secondary membranes, and long‑term risk of glaucoma—regular monitoring is required for years. - Medical options: in very small central cataracts, dilating drops (e.g., low‑dose atropine) may temporarily improve vision, but there is no medical cure for structural cataract. - Practical tips: ensure adherence to patching and contact lens/glasses use, keep follow-up appointments, report redness, discharge, decreased eye contact, or feeding/behavior changes; ask for written surgery and anesthesia instructions and resources for contact lens fitting and visual rehabilitation. - Support: ask your pediatric ophthalmologist about genetic counseling, early intervention/vision therapy services, and support groups to help with care and developmental monitoring.
Referrals: ophthalmologist; genetic consultation; pediatrician for metabolic evaluation


CASE 19 — Ocular Hypertension
=============================
Subjective

LATERALITY: OU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 42-year-old Caucasian man referred after optometrist noted high eye pressures and possible glaucoma; asymptomatic, unremarkable medical and family history, not on medications.
History Narrative: A 42-year-old Caucasian man was referred to the eye clinic after being told by an optometrist that his eye pressures were high and that he might have glaucoma. Past medical history and family history were unremarkable. He was not taking any medications. Ocular examination revealed visual acuity of 20/20 OU without correction. Pupils and motility were normal. Anterior segment biomicroscopic examination was unremarkable with a clear cornea and lens. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 27 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS. Gonioscopy revealed angles open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees with moderate pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork. Dilated funduscopic examination revealed symmetric optic nerves with normal cupping. The cup-to-disc ratio was 0.2, with an intact neuroretinal rim OU. The macula, vessels, periphery, and vitreous were normal in appearance. A 24–2 Humphrey automated perimetry was performed, which revealed no visual field defects in either eye.
Characteristics: Elevated intraocular pressure with normal-appearing optic nerves and normal visual fields; open angles with moderate trabecular meshwork pigmentation; no corneal or lens abnormalities; 20/20 OU vision; cup-to-disc ratio 0.2 OU; 24–2 Humphrey visual fields normal.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Ocular hypertension: 42-year-old Caucasian man with bilateral elevated IOPs (27 mm Hg OD, 28 mm Hg OS), normal visual acuity 20/20 OU, normal pupils and motility, unremarkable anterior segment, open angles to ciliary body band 360° with moderate trabecular meshwork pigmentation, symmetric optic nerves with normal cupping (cup-to-disc ratio 0.2) and intact neuroretinal rims OU, normal macula/vessels/periphery, and normal 24-2 Humphrey visual fields OU. Most consistent with idiopathic ocular hypertension; no current evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy or visual field loss. Recommend measurement of central corneal thickness, baseline OCT and serial visual fields/OCT monitoring, and individualized consideration of IOP-lowering therapy given mid-to-high 20s pressures and patient age; follow-up at 6–12 months if observing, or within 4 weeks after initiating therapy.
Primary Diagnosis: Ocular hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Idiopathic ocular hypertension; Early primary open-angle glaucoma; Secondary ocular hypertension from pigment dispersion syndrome; Secondary ocular hypertension from pseudoexfoliation syndrome
Severity: Mild
Laterality: OU
Complications: Potential complications of treatment include medication side effects (ocular surface irritation, allergic reactions, systemic beta-blocker effects), laser trabeculoplasty complications (transient IOP spike, inflammation), and filtration surgery complications (hypotony, infection, bleb failure, blebitis, endophthalmitis).


Plan
All Procedures: gonioscopy Goldmann applanation tonometry measurement of central corneal thickness (pachymetry) slit-lamp examination (including dilated funduscopic exam) stereoscopic optic nerve examination (fundus contact lens/Hruby/78-D or 90-D) red-free slit-lamp imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) 24–2 Humphrey automated perimetry laser peripheral iridotomy (mentioned as treatment for narrow angles) panretinal photocoagulation (for rubeosis iridis) laser trabeculoplasty (not recommended routinely) glaucoma filtration surgery (not recommended routinely)
Follow-Up Instructions: Initially see every 6–12 months. Yearly visual field testing and/or OCT and dilated optic nerve exam. If treated, return within 4 weeks after starting therapy; once stable after adjustments, exam every 4–6 months for at least 2 years. If stable for many years, every 6–12 months.
Patient Education: Explain that you have ocular hypertension (high eye pressure) but normal optic nerves and visual fields now; discuss risk that high pressure can damage the optic nerve over time and that treatment is tailored to individual risk factors (age, corneal thickness, race, family history). Review options: close observation with regular visits (IOP check, optic nerve exam, annual visual field and/or OCT) versus starting pressure-lowering eye drops to reduce future glaucoma risk. Explain the need for pachymetry (corneal thickness) and gonioscopy results to guide decisions. If treated, review how to use prescribed eye drops, possible side effects, and the need for a follow-up visit in ~4 weeks to check effectiveness. Emphasize adherence, reporting new symptoms (vision changes, eye pain, redness), and keeping scheduled exams every 4–12 months per plan.

Examination revealed 20/20 vision OU, myopic refractions (-3.00 +2.25 x110 OD, -2.25 +2.00 x86 OS), normal pupils without RAPD, normal anterior slit-lamp, IOPs 26 mm Hg OD and 32 mm Hg OS, open angles (grade IV) with 360° ciliary body band and 1+ trabecular meshwork pigment, optic nerve cupping with inferior rim thinning OU, and corresponding superior arcuate visual field defects (early OD, more advanced OS).
History Narrative: A 51-year-old African American man presented for a routine eye exam. He had no past ocular problems and no current visual complaints. Past medical history was remarkable for mild emphysema for which he used inhalers. Examination revealed visual acuities of 20/20 in each eye, with a refraction of –3.00 +2.25 ×110 OD and –2.25 +2.00 ×86 OS. The pupils reacted normally with no afferent pupillary defect. Anterior slit-lamp examination was unremarkable, and pressures by applanation tonometry were 26 mm Hg OD and 32 mm Hg OS. Gonioscopy showed grade IV angles in both eyes with a clear view of the ciliary body band for 360 degrees and 1+ pigment of the trabecular meshwork. On funduscopic exam, the optic nerves demonstrated generalized enlarged cups with thinning of the inferior neural rim (more marked in the left eye). Automated visual fields showed an early superior arcuate defect in the right eye and a more advanced superior arcuate defect in the left eye. There were no abnormalities of the retina or vessels.
Progression: Evidence of progressive optic nerve damage or visual field decline
Characteristics: Primary open-angle glaucoma: elevated IOPs, open angles (grade IV with ciliary body band visible 360°), optic nerve cupping with inferior rim thinning, arcuate visual field defects (superior arcuate defects OD early, OS more advanced), 1+ trabecular meshwork pigment, no corneal or iris signs of secondary glaucoma, no APD, VA 20/20 OU, mild myopic refraction OD −3.00+2.25×110, OS −2.25+2.00×86.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Primary open-angle glaucoma based on elevated intraocular pressures (OD 26 mm Hg, OS 32 mm Hg), open angles on gonioscopy (grade IV with 360° ciliary body band), optic nerve head cupping with inferior rim thinning OU (more marked OS), and corresponding superior arcuate visual field defects (early OD, more advanced OS). No signs of secondary causes (no Krukenberg spindle, iris transillumination defects, pseudoexfoliative material, or inflammatory findings). Visual acuity 20/20 OU. Risk factors/significance: moderate bilateral POAG with greater severity in the left eye; target IOP should be at least ~20% below untreated levels and lower for the more damaged eye. Recommend initiation of IOP-lowering therapy (medical therapy and/or consider laser trabeculoplasty) with close follow-up of IOP, optic nerve appearance, and visual fields, and obtain baseline CCT and optic nerve/RNFL imaging.
Primary Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Mild emphysema
Differential Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma; Pigmentary glaucoma; Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma; Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: β-blockers topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prostaglandin analogs adrenergic agonists miotics apraclonidine 5-fluorouracil mitomycin C
All Procedures: gonioscopy, slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometry, dilated funduscopic examination (stereoscopic optic nerve evaluation), automated visual field testing, red-free nerve fiber layer assessment, central corneal thickness measurement (ultrasound pachymetry or anterior segment OCT), optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer imaging (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, scanning laser polarimetry, OCT), selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT), trabeculectomy (with possible antimetabolite use: 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C), glaucoma drainage implant placement (Baerveldt, Molteno, Ahmed), transscleral cyclodestructive procedures (cryoablation, cyclophotocoagulation), endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation, micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (trabecular meshwork micro-bypass stents, intracanalicular scaffolding devices, supraciliary microstents, ab interno trabeculotomy, ab interno canaloplasty, subconjunctival filtering device implantation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up frequency based on disease severity, target IOP achievement, evidence of progression, and duration of control; at each visit check medication side effects and compliance, measure visual acuity and IOP, evaluate the optic nerve (stereoscopic photos as baseline) and perform repeat visual field testing as indicated; adjust therapy for failure to meet target IOP, progressive optic nerve or visual field loss, or medication side effects/noncompliance.
Patient Education: You have primary open‑angle glaucoma, which means the drainage in the eye is not lowering eye pressure enough and has caused characteristic changes to your optic nerves and visual fields. The goal of treatment is to lower your intraocular pressure to a safe “target” (generally at least 20% below your baseline) to prevent further nerve damage and vision loss. What to expect: - Medical therapy: eye drops are usually first-line (prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists) to lower pressure; often started in one eye first to judge effect. - Laser option: selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) can lower pressure and is an option if drops aren’t suitable or effective. - Surgery: If medications/laser don’t control pressure or disease progresses, procedures such as trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage implants, or newer minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries may be recommended. - Monitoring: regular follow-up visits to check vision, eye pressure, optic nerve appearance, and visual fields; imaging (OCT) and corneal thickness measurement may be used to guide care. - Risks and side effects: eye drops and surgeries have potential side effects; discuss allergies, lung/heart conditions, and medication adherence with your doctor. - Self-care: take drops exactly as prescribed, keep follow-up appointments, report new vision changes or pain, and avoid missing medications; bring a list of medications and notify provider of inhaler use or systemic illness. You will work with your ophthalmologist to set an individualized target pressure and a monitoring/treatment plan to preserve your remaining vision.


CASE 21 — Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma
========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye
DURATION: several hours
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have had several hours of discomfort and my left eye is blurry."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 55-year-old woman presented with several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye. She denied prior repeated brief episodes. On exam vision was 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS; IOPs 14 mm Hg OD and 52 mm Hg OS. The left pupil was mid-dilated and sluggish. Slit-lamp showed mild conjunctival/episcleral hyperemia, mild corneal epithelial edema, a shallow peripheral anterior chamber with midperipheral iris bowed anteriorly (iris bombé). Gonioscopy OS showed marked iris convexity and no visible angle structures (closed angle); OD had a narrow but open angle. No medications or lens findings suggesting lens-induced angle closure; no history suggesting neovascular, uveitic, traumatic, or other secondary causes. Acute onset consistent with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old woman presented with several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye. She reported acute onset of symptoms without prior recurrent brief episodes. She denied use of medications associated with angle closure. Family history of angle-closure glaucoma not stated. Examination at presentation showed vision 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS, IOPs 14 mm Hg OD and 52 mm Hg OS, a sluggish middilated pupil OS, mild conjunctival and episcleral hyperemia OS, mild corneal epithelial edema OS, and a shallow peripheral anterior chamber with midperipheral iris bowed anteriorly (iris bombé) touching the cornea OS. Lens examination showed mild nuclear sclerosis. Gonioscopy revealed a closed anterior chamber angle OS with no visible angle structures and a narrow but open angle OD. Optic nerve cups were small bilaterally. She was not taking sulfonamides or other drugs known to cause angle closure and had no findings suggestive of lens-induced, neovascular, uveitic, traumatic, nanophthalmic, or malignant-glaucoma causes.
Symptom Onset: several hours
Symptom Duration: several hours
Progression: Acute (resolved after treatment)
Characteristics: Acute onset left eye discomfort and blurred vision; middilated sluggish pupil, conjunctival/episcleral hyperemia, mild corneal epithelial edema, shallow peripheral anterior chamber, midperipheral iris bowed anteriorly (iris bombé) with peripheral iris–cornea touch; marked convex iris contour and closed anterior chamber angle on gonioscopy; IOP 52 mm Hg in affected eye; fellow eye narrow/occludable angle with small optic cups.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: close work, emotional state, and ambient light level
Associated Symptoms: discomfort, blurred vision, colored halos around lights, eye pain, eye redness, nausea, vomiting
Previous Episodes: No prior episodes; she denied repeated, brief episodes.
Prior Treatments: medical therapy and laser iridotomy
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant temporary impairment — left eye vision reduced to 20/60 with pain, blurred vision, corneal edema and very high IOP causing discomfort and limiting function until treated; right eye largely unaffected but at risk, so overall daily activities notably disrupted during acute episode.
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: Approximately 50% of fellow eyes will develop an acute attack within 5 years.
Risk Factors: Age 55 (peak incidence 55–70), female sex, shallow/narrow anterior chamber anatomy (hyperopia predisposition), fellow eye narrow angle (occludable), presence of mild nuclear sclerosis (lens changes), possible plateau iris component, Caucasian (implied)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Narrow anterior chamber angle, at risk for subsequent angle-closure glaucoma. Left eye: Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma — left eye with IOP 52 mm Hg, middilated sluggish pupil, corneal epithelial edema, conjunctival/episcleral hyperemia, iris bombé with peripheral anterior chamber closure on gonioscopy; responded to medical therapy and laser peripheral iridotomy with opening of the angle and normalization of IOP.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (left eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Pupillary block (acute primary angle‑closure glaucoma); Plateau iris configuration; Lens-induced (phacomorphic/aphakic or lens subluxation) angle-closure glaucoma; Secondary angle-closure from uveitis/neovascularization (synechial)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: - Corneal epithelial edema - Persistent elevated IOP leading to optic nerve damage (glaucomatous optic neuropathy) - Peripheral anterior synechiae formation - Iris ischemia with sphincter paralysis (pupillary dysfunction) - Anterior segment inflammation - Glaukomflecken (cataractous lens changes) in prior attacks - Need for surgical interventions (laser iridotomy/iridoplasty, goniosynechialysis, cataract extraction) - Recurrent or chronic angle closure with persistent IOP elevation


Plan
All Medications: isosorbide; glycerol; mannitol; acetazolamide (IV or oral); topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; pilocarpine 2% (topical); topical beta-blockers; topical alpha-2 agonists; prostaglandin analogs; topical corticosteroids; analgesics; antiemetics
All Procedures: medical therapy; laser peripheral iridotomy (left eye); gonioscopy; IOP measurement; slit-lamp biomicroscopy; anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Measure IOP within 30–120 minutes after laser surgery. - Re-examine within 1 week postoperatively. - Re-examine again at 4–8 weeks postoperatively. - Taper topical corticosteroids during the postoperative period. - Perform pupillary dilation with post-dilation IOP check and gonioscopy to confirm angle remains open; consider more frequent visits if inadequate response.
Patient Education: You have acute primary angle‑closure glaucoma in your left eye, which means the front drainage angle of the eye is blocked causing a sudden rise in eye pressure. This is a sight‑threatening emergency but can be treated effectively. What caused it - Most commonly due to a pupillary block: the iris bows forward (iris bombé) and contacts the cornea, preventing fluid from exiting the eye. - Risk factors: being middle‑aged, farsighted (hyperopic) eyes, family history, and certain ethnicities. Symptoms to expect - Sudden eye pain, redness, blurred vision, and colored halos around lights. - Nausea or vomiting may occur when pressure is very high. Immediate treatments you received or will receive - Medicines to quickly lower eye pressure (oral or IV osmotics, acetazolamide, topical pressure‑lowering drops). - Pilocarpine may be used to constrict the pupil if the muscle can still respond. - Laser peripheral iridotomy (small hole in the iris) is the definitive treatment to relieve pupillary block and open the angle; it often lowers pressure and improves symptoms. What happens next - The fellow (other) eye is usually at risk and is commonly treated preventively with a laser iridotomy after the affected eye is stable. - Follow‑up visits are needed soon (within hours to days after laser) to check pressure, inflammation, and that the angle is open. - Eye drops (steroids, pressure‑lowering) and short‑term pain/antiemetic medications may be prescribed. When to seek urgent care - Worsening pain, vision loss, increasing redness, persistent nausea/vomiting, or if you develop similar symptoms in the other eye. Long‑term outlook - If treated promptly with laser iridotomy and medical care, most patients’ pressures normalize and vision recovers; delayed treatment increases risk of permanent optic nerve damage. Questions to ask your doctor - Is the iridotomy patent and did it open my angle? - Do I need the other eye treated? - What medications should I take and for how long? - When is my next follow‑up and what symptoms require immediate return?
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care (emergency eye clinic or ophthalmologist). Do not dilate the pupils. If severe eye pain, vision loss, halos, nausea or vomiting occur, go to the nearest emergency department or eye emergency service right away. Avoid medications that dilate pupils; bring a list of current medications and any eye drops.


CASE 22 — Pigmentary Glaucoma
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Routine eye examination (asymptomatic)
LATERALITY: Bilateral

History Narrative: A 32-year-old myopic man presents for routine eye examination. He currently has no complaints and denies any significant past ocular or medical history. Examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in each eye and no afferent pupillary defect in either eye. Intraocular pressures by applanation were 28 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS. Slit‑lamp examination disclosed vertically oriented pigment deposition on each corneal endothelium and numerous spokelike iris transillumination defects in both eyes. Gonioscopy showed fully open angles (360 degrees) in each eye with dense pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork bilaterally. On funduscopic examination, the right optic nerve had a cup‑to‑disc ratio of approximately 0.7 with inferotemporal thinning at the neuroretinal rim; the left eye had a cup‑to‑disc ratio of 0.55. Retinal examination was normal. Spectral‑domain optical coherence tomography retinal nerve fiber layer analysis showed moderate thinning of the inferotemporal RNFL in the right eye and mild thinning in the left eye. Automated visual field testing demonstrated a moderate superior arcuate defect in the right eye and an early nasal step in the left eye.
Progression: Moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma with progressive visual field loss (right: moderate superior arcuate; left: early nasal step)
Characteristics: Young myopic man with pigment liberation from posterior iris epithelium causing dense, even trabecular meshwork pigmentation, Krukenberg spindle, iris transillumination defects, open angles (360°), elevated IOPs (28 OD, 26 OS), glaucomatous optic nerve cupping (CDR 0.7 OD, 0.55 OS) with RNFL thinning and corresponding visual field defects (moderate superior arcuate OD, early nasal step OS).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 32-year-old myopic man with bilateral pigmentary glaucoma. IOPs elevated OU (28 OD, 26 OS) with slit-lamp findings of Krukenberg spindles and spoke-like iris transillumination defects, and gonioscopy showing 360° open angles with dense, evenly distributed trabecular meshwork pigmentation. Optic nerve: OD C/D ~0.7 with inferotemporal rim thinning; OS C/D 0.55. SD‑OCT RNFL: moderate inferotemporal thinning OD, mild thinning OS. Visual fields: moderate superior arcuate defect OD, early nasal step OS. Overall moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma OD with superior arcuate defect and moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma OS with early nasal step; management options include topical IOP-lowering therapy (targeting 20–30% reduction), consideration of ALT/SLT (monocular 180° trial first) or laser peripheral iridotomy to reduce iris–zonule chafing, with escalation to incisional surgery if progression occurs. Baseline optic nerve photos, automated perimetry, and SD‑OCT obtained and will be followed at regular intervals.
Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: Moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma with superior arcuate defect; Left eye: Moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma with early nasal step defect
Differential Diagnosis: Pigmentary glaucoma; Primary open-angle glaucoma; Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma; Uveitic glaucoma
Severity: Moderate-stage
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: pilocarpine (miotic), prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic agonists
All Procedures: laser peripheral iridotomy; argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) — 180° monocular trial initially; selective laser trabeculoplasty (with caution); trabeculectomy; Ex‑Press glaucoma mini‑shunt implantation; glaucoma drainage implant; minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (e.g., iStent trabecular microbypass, gonioscopy‑assisted transluminal trabeculotomy, endocyclophotocoagulation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up based on treatment effectiveness, disease stability, severity, and patient reliability; schedule visits and repeat testing (IOP checks, optic nerve exams, visual fields, and SD‑OCT) at intervals tailored to those factors (at minimum visual field and SD‑OCT at least annually, more often if progression or instability).
Patient Education: Pigmentary glaucoma is a form of open‑angle glaucoma seen most often in young, nearsighted men. It occurs when pigment rubbed off the back of the iris clogs the eye’s drainage tissue, causing elevated eye pressure that can damage the optic nerve. Typical findings include pigment on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle), dense uniform trabecular pigmentation, and iris transillumination defects. Symptoms can be absent at rest but may include blurry vision or sudden pressure spikes after exercise. Goals of treatment: lower and stabilize intraocular pressure to prevent further optic nerve and visual field loss. Treatment options include eye drops (prostaglandin analogs, beta‑blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists; miotics like pilocarpine are effective but often poorly tolerated), laser procedures (argon or selective laser trabeculoplasty to improve outflow; laser peripheral iridotomy may reduce pigment release), and, if needed, incisional glaucoma surgery or minimally invasive glaucoma procedures. What to expect: - Regular testing (tonometry, optic nerve photos, visual fields, and OCT RNFL) at least annually, often more frequently until stable. - Possible need for long‑term eye drops; surgical or laser therapy if medications are inadequate or not tolerated. - Exercise can cause transient pigment release and pressure spikes — report sudden visual changes or eye pain. - Keep scheduled follow‑ups and promptly report new symptoms (worsening vision, eye pain, halos, severe headache). Lifestyle and monitoring: - Adhere to medications; bring bottles to visits. - Avoid activities that repeatedly cause forceful pupil movement if they trigger symptoms. - Family members may benefit from screening due to hereditary tendency. If you have questions about treatments, side effects, or the need for laser or surgery, discuss risks and benefits with your ophthalmologist.

Differential Diagnosis: Neovascular glaucoma; Acute angle-closure glaucoma (primary or secondary); Traumatic hyphema/angle recession glaucoma; Iridocyclitis (acute)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: corneal edema, hyphema, permanent angle-closure with irreversible trabecular damage leading to refractory elevated IOP and potential glaucomatous optic neuropathy (vision loss), intraoperative and postoperative bleeding during surgery, need for repeat surgeries or cyclodestructive procedures, chronic pain, possible enucleation


Plan
All Medications: oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; topical beta‑blocker; topical alpha‑2 agonist; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; topical prednisolone; topical cycloplegic; prostaglandin analog (use debated); hyperosmotic agents; intravitreal anti‑VEGF agent; medications for nausea/vomiting (non‑oral routes)
All Procedures: - Visual acuity assessment - Slit-lamp examination - Gonioscopy - Ophthalmoscopy (dilated fundus exam) - B-scan ultrasonography - Intraocular pressure measurement - Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor administration - Topical beta-blocker, alpha-2 agonist, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor administration - Topical prednisolone and cycloplegic administration - Antiemetic (sublingual/nonoral) administration - Anterior chamber paracentesis - Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection - Panretinal photocoagulation - Aqueous shunt implantation (e.g., Ahmed or Baerveldt) - Trabeculectomy (considered option) - Cyclodestructive procedures (diode/Nd:YAG laser or cryotherapy) - Retrobulbar alcohol injection - Enucleation
Follow-Up Instructions: Urgent ophthalmology follow-up with glaucoma specialist (or return to ED) within 24–48 hours for IOP recheck and repeat anterior/posterior evaluation; arrange panretinal photocoagulation or intravitreal anti‑VEGF once posterior view permits; schedule ongoing close monitoring and definitive glaucoma surgery (aqueous shunt) as indicated.
Patient Education: Neovascular glaucoma is a serious eye condition where abnormal new blood vessels grow in the front of the eye, blocking fluid drainage and causing very high eye pressure. This can cause severe pain, redness, blurry vision, headache, nausea, and sometimes bleeding in the eye. It most often occurs after conditions that reduce blood flow to the retina (for example, diabetic eye disease or a central retinal vein occlusion). Key points for you: - Immediate treatment is needed to lower the eye pressure and relieve pain; this may include eye drops, oral medications, and sometimes procedures in the emergency setting. - Treatment also targets the underlying cause of the abnormal vessels (for example, laser treatment of the retina and injections of medicines called anti-VEGF) to try to stop the new vessel growth. - Surgery (glaucoma drainage implants) is often required if medical therapy and injections do not control the pressure. - Rapid treatment improves comfort and can reduce the risk of permanent vision loss, but prognosis depends on the extent of prior retinal damage. - Report worsening pain, vision loss, severe nausea/vomiting, or increasing redness immediately. - Keep all follow-up appointments; you may need urgent retinal or glaucoma procedures and frequent monitoring. - Bring a list of your current medical conditions (especially diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease) and medications; discuss any kidney problems, heart disease, or pregnancy before certain medications are used. - Use prescribed eye drops exactly as directed and do not stop medications without discussing with your eye doctor.
Emergency Instructions: Lower intraocular pressure urgently (oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ± topical aqueous suppressants such as beta-blocker/alpha-2 agonist/additional topical CAI); give topical prednisolone and cycloplegic for pain/inflammation; consider anti-VEGF intravitreal injection once posterior causes ruled out; anterior chamber paracentesis if needed for very high IOP; treat nausea/vomiting with non‑oral antiemetics.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis of the left eye with secondary open‑angle inflammatory glaucoma (IOP 46 mmHg OS); left eye corneal fine stellate KPs, 2+ AC cells/flare, patchy pupillary sphincter iris atrophy, open angles with moderate trabecular pigmentation and no PAS; right eye normal. Elevated IOP requires prompt inflammation control and aqueous‑suppressant therapy; consider antiviral therapy (oral acyclovir ± topical trifluridine), topical corticosteroid and cycloplegic, and glaucoma surgery if IOP not controlled.
Primary Diagnosis: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis; Secondary open angle glaucoma (inflammatory glaucoma)
Differential Diagnosis: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis causing secondary open-angle inflammatory glaucoma; Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis; HLA-B27–associated anterior uveitis; Posner–Schlossman syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: glaucomatous optic neuropathy; peripheral anterior synechiae formation; cataract; band keratopathy; cystoid macular edema (CME); steroid-induced IOP elevation; recurrent/herpetic keratouveitis recurrence


Plan
All Medications: trifluridine; prednisolone 1%; dexamethasone 0.1%; rimexolone; loteprednol; flurbiprofen; ketorolac; diclofenac; methotrexate; azathioprine; timolol; levobunolol; dorzolamide; brinzolamide; apraclonidine; dipivefrin; latanoprost; oral acyclovir; topical trifluridine; atropine; cyclopentolate; 5‑fluorouracil; mitomycin C
All Procedures: trifluridine eye drops; slit-lamp examination; gonioscopy; dilated funduscopic examination; serologic workup (RPR/FTA-ABS); serum or aqueous titers for toxoplasmosis; PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; HLA haplotype testing; ANA testing; topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%); topical rimexolone or loteprednol; topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (flurbiprofen, ketorolac, diclofenac); oral immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate, azathioprine) [if severe]; topical beta-blockers (timolol, levobunolol); topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide, brinzolamide); topical adrenergic agonists (apraclonidine, dipivefrin); prostaglandin analogs (latanoprost) [when appropriate]; oral acyclovir; topical trifluridine; cycloplegic agents (atropine, cyclopentolate); laser peripheral iridotomy; surgical iridectomy; trabeculectomy with antimetabolite (5‑fluorouracil or mitomycin C); implantation of glaucoma drainage device (Ahmed valve, Molteno implant); laser cyclophotocoagulation
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequent follow-up with serial IOP checks, optic nerve exams and visual field testing; monitor and treat intraocular inflammation (adjust steroids as needed); perform gonioscopy at each visit to detect PAS or neovascularization; screen for complications (CME, band keratopathy) and manage appropriately; defer glaucoma surgery until inflammation is controlled unless IOP remains dangerous despite maximal medical therapy.
Patient Education: You have an inflammatory form of glaucoma caused by herpes simplex uveitis. This means inflammation inside the eye is raising your eye pressure, which can damage the optic nerve if not controlled. Key points: - Goals of treatment: reduce inflammation and lower intraocular pressure to prevent vision loss. - Medications you may receive: topical steroid eye drops (e.g., prednisolone) to control inflammation; pressure-lowering eye drops (beta blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) to lower IOP; cycloplegic drops (e.g., atropine) for pain and to prevent synechiae; and antiviral therapy (oral acyclovir and/or topical trifluridine) because this is herpetic. - Take drops exactly as prescribed; do not stop steroids suddenly without your doctor’s advice. Report worsening pain, vision loss, flashing lights, or increasing redness immediately. - Follow-up is essential and frequent at first to monitor inflammation, IOP, and the optic nerve; gonioscopy and visual field testing will be performed over time. - Surgery (filtering surgery or a glaucoma drainage device) is reserved if medications fail or optic nerve damage progresses; surgery is usually delayed until inflammation is controlled. - Risks to understand: recurrent inflammation, steroid-induced pressure rise, cataract formation, and potential permanent glaucomatous vision loss if untreated. - Lifestyle: avoid eye rubbing; bring a list of all eye drops to each visit; inform providers of any systemic symptoms or immunosuppression. If you have questions about side effects or need urgent evaluation for pain or vision change, contact your ophthalmologist promptly.


CASE 25 — Primary Congenital Glaucoma
=====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: "cloudy eyes and tearing" for 3 to 4 weeks
DURATION: 3 to 4 weeks
LATERALITY: bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "cloudy eyes and tearing"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 3-month-old female infant was referred after her mother noted “cloudy eyes and tearing” for 3–4 weeks; she was photophobic and more comfortable in dim illumination. Both eyes had diffuse corneal haze (R>L), estimated corneal diameters 12 mm OD and 11 mm OS, and IOPs measured in clinic with iCare while nursing were 45 mm Hg OD and 36 mm Hg OS. The child was full-term with uneventful pregnancy and delivery (no forceps), no known family history of glaucoma, and a healthy 3-year-old brother.
History Narrative: A 3-month-old female infant was referred after her mother noted “cloudy eyes and tearing” for 3 to 4 weeks. The child was the product of a full-term uneventful pregnancy and delivery with no use of forceps. There was no known family history of glaucoma and she had a 3-year-old brother without any ocular problems. On examination in the office, the child was photophobic and was more comfortable in dim illumination. Both eyes had a diffuse corneal haze, the right more than the left. Estimated corneal diameters measured in the office were 12 mm in her right eye and 11 mm in her left eye. Intraocular pressure measurements taken with iCare while the infant nursed on a bottle were 45 mm Hg in the right eye and 36 mm Hg in the left eye.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 3-month-old female with bilateral primary congenital glaucoma, more severe in the right eye — presenting with 3–4 weeks of photophobia, epiphora and corneal clouding; exam notable for right corneal diameter 12 mm, left 11 mm, IOPs measured in clinic by iCare 45 mm Hg (OD) and 36 mm Hg (OS), diffuse corneal edema greater OD, likely Haab’s striae and buphthalmos; no family history. Plan: urgent preoperative medical IOP reduction (topical/oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ± selective beta-blocker with pediatric dosing precautions), obtain pediatric/anesthesia clearance, perform full examination under anesthesia with confirmatory IOPs, corneal diameters, A-scan axial lengths, gonioscopy and fundus evaluation, and proceed to angle surgery (goniotomy or trabeculotomy treating 360°) at same anesthetic session if confirmed; post-op topical cycloplegic and steroid, follow-up EUA at 8–10 weeks and regular serial exams for IOP, corneal clarity, axial length and optic nerve assessment.
Primary Diagnosis: Primary congenital glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Primary congenital glaucoma; Congenital corneal/ anterior segment disorders (Peters anomaly, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, posterior polymorphous dystrophy); Birth trauma/forceps-associated corneal opacity; Secondary glaucoma from intraocular tumor or uveitis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: iCare (device) — N/A Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide) Topical beta‑blocker (selective; low dose ~0.25% for young children) Topical alpha‑2 agonists — contraindicated in infants Oral acetazolamide (5–10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours) Topical cycloplegics (postop) Topical steroids (postop) Mitomycin C (antimetabolite, used with trabeculectomy)
All Procedures: iCare IOP measurement, Examination under general anesthesia (including Tonopen/Perkins IOP, corneal diameter, A-scan axial length, ultrasonography/biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, dilated fundus exam/optic disc photos), Goniotomy, Trabeculotomy (360-degree angle surgery), Placement of glaucoma drainage device (Baerveldt shunt), Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (not preferred), Cyclodestructive procedures, Topical medical therapy (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta‑blockers), Oral acetazolamide, Postoperative topical cycloplegics and steroids, Disc photography (stereoscopic)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Place on topical cycloplegics and steroids for 1–2 weeks postoperatively. - Perform a second examination under anesthesia at 8–10 weeks with repeat measurements; if IOP acceptable, dilate for disc photography and fundus exam. - Continue examinations under anesthesia every 2–3 months until IOP stable or office exam possible. - Once examinable in clinic, follow every 3–4 months, then extend to every 6 months when stable. - By age 3–4 years, transition to routine office examinations.
Patient Education: Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a condition in infants caused by abnormal drainage of fluid from the eye, leading to high eye pressure that can damage vision. In your child’s case, signs include tearing, light sensitivity, cloudy/enlarged corneas, and elevated intraocular pressure. Key points for parents: - PCG is usually treated surgically (angle surgery: goniotomy or trabeculotomy) and often needs to be done promptly to prevent permanent vision loss. Surgery is usually done under general anesthesia and may be performed at the initial full exam under anesthesia. - Medications (eye drops or oral acetazolamide) may be used short-term before surgery to lower pressure and reduce corneal clouding. - After surgery, the child will need short-term steroid and cycloplegic eye drops and close follow-up exams (often under anesthesia initially) to monitor pressure, corneal clarity, eye growth, and the optic nerve. Typical follow-up is at 8–10 weeks post-op, then every 2–3 months until stable, and less often as the child grows. - Long-term monitoring is essential because additional procedures or glaucoma devices (e.g., Baerveldt implant) may be needed if pressure is not controlled. - Avoid medications that are contraindicated in infants (e.g., alpha‑2 agonists). Beta‑blocker drops, if used, are given at reduced concentration and with caution. - Watch for signs of problems: increased tearing, worsening cloudiness, excessive redness, poor feeding/sedation (from systemic medication effects), or changes in eye appearance—seek care promptly. - Genetic and family considerations: PCG can be inherited; discuss family history and genetic counseling if desired. - Coordinate care with the pediatrician and anesthesiologist to ensure the child is medically cleared for anesthesia. If you have questions about the planned surgery, anesthesia, or postoperative care, please ask the surgeon so you understand timing, risks, and what to expect during recovery.


CASE 26 — Ocular Hypotony
=========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Worsening vision
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 45-year-old woman with inflammatory glaucoma in her aphakic right eye, referred for surgical management after progressive disease; preoperative IOP 40 mm Hg on maximal medical therapy with oral agents, vision 20/20 with aphakic correction, and 1+ cell and flare in the AC. She underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy; IOP was 9–12 mm Hg for the first postoperative year, but 1 year after surgery she presented with worsening vision (VA 20/60, improving to 20/20 with +1.50 D), an elevated avascular cystic bleb, macular chorioretinal folds, and an IOP of 3 mm Hg.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old woman with inflammatory glaucoma in her aphakic right eye and only light perception in the left eye since birth due to persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous was referred for surgical management. Preoperatively she had 20/20 aphakic-corrected visual acuity, IOP 40 mm Hg on maximal medical therapy including oral agents, central corneal thickness 535 μm OU, 1+ AC cell and flare with scattered fine keratic precipitates, vitreous at the pupillary plane, a markedly excavated optic disc (cup-to-disc 0.9 with an inferior notch) and a superior altitudinal visual field defect. She underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy. Postoperatively visual acuity remained 20/20 and IOP was 9–12 mm Hg for the first postoperative year. One year after surgery she presented with worsening vision: visual acuity 20/60, improved to 20/20 with +1.50 D hyperopic correction; exam showed a highly elevated, avascular, cystic bleb, moderate chorioretinal folds involving the posterior pole and macula, and IOP 3 mm Hg. The eye was quiet without significant inflammation, Seidel test was negative, gonioscopy excluded a cyclodialysis cleft, axial length was 0.75 mm shorter and refraction 1.5 D more hyperopic than baseline, no retinal or choroidal detachment was present, and she denied topical or systemic aqueous suppressants.
Symptom Onset: 1 year after surgery
Symptom Duration: 1 year
Progression: Resolved


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Surgical filtration (trabeculectomy with mitomycin C) leading to overfiltration; use of mitomycin C; early postoperative excessive aqueous outflow; possible conjunctival thinning from steroids
Alleviating Factors: Discontinuation of aqueous suppressants; cycloplegia; topical corticosteroids (with caution); autologous blood patch; bandage contact lens; bleb compression sutures; resuturing of scleral flap/revision surgery; observation.
Associated Symptoms: worsening vision; decreased visual acuity (20/60 improving to 20/20 with +1.50 D); hyperopic shift (+1.50 D); chorioretinal folds involving posterior pole and macula; relative globe contraction (shortened axial length)
Prior Treatments: maximum medical therapy including oral agents
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — temporary visual impairment (reduced to 20/60, correctable to 20/20 with +1.50 D) causing transient functional limitation until treated.
Systemic Symptoms: None
Risk Factors: - History of filtration surgery (trabeculectomy with mitomycin C) - Use of antimetabolite (mitomycin C) - Young age (45 years) with more compliant sclera - Aphakia - Subtotal vitrectomy (vitreous at pupillary plane preop) - Chronic preoperative aqueous suppression (on maximum medical therapy)

Fundus Exam – Macula: Moderate chorioretinal folds involving the posterior pole and macula
Fundus Exam – Vessels: Normal
Fundus Exam – Periphery: No retinal detachment; peripheral retina with no reported hemorrhages or lesions (unremarkable)


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Hypotony due to primary overfiltration: one year after uncomplicated trabeculectomy with MMC and subtotal vitrectomy the patient developed marked hypotony (IOP 3 mm Hg) with a large, highly elevated avascular Seidel-negative bleb, maculopathy with chorioretinal folds and hyperopic shift (+1.50 D; axial length decreased by 0.75 mm). Eye was quiet without inflammation; gonioscopy excluded cyclodialysis cleft; no retinal or choroidal detachment and no history of continued aqueous suppressants. Initial medical measures (cycloplegia, topical steroids) and autologous blood patch failed; surgical resuturing of the scleral flap (two additional sutures) restored IOP into the 20s, normalized axial length, refraction and visual acuity; subsequent suture lysis produced IOP 13 mm Hg and long-term IOP remained in the low teens without recurrent hypotony.
Primary Diagnosis: Hypotony due to primary overfiltration
Differential Diagnosis: Primary overfiltration; Bleb leak; Cyclodialysis cleft; Decreased aqueous production (pharmacologic or inflammatory)
Laterality: Right
Complications: Hypotony with maculopathy (chorioretinal folds, decreased vision)


Plan
All Medications: cycloplegic agents; topical corticosteroids; aqueous suppressants; oral agents (for glaucoma); mitomycin C; autologous blood (for blood patch)
All Procedures: - Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C - Subtotal vitrectomy - Seidel test - Gonioscopy - Fundus examination - Autologous blood patch (attempted) - Surgical revision with placement of two additional scleral flap sutures (scleral flap resuturing) - Suture lysis
Patient Education: Explain that ocular hypotony means abnormally low eye pressure, a known complication after filtration surgery. Describe common causes (overfiltration, wound leak, reduced aqueous production, cyclodialysis cleft) and symptoms to watch for—blurred vision, change in glasses prescription, visual distortion, or eye pain. Instruct to stop any aqueous‑suppressing drops unless directed otherwise. Emphasize the need for urgent follow‑up if vision worsens or symptoms develop. Outline typical evaluation: IOP check, slit‑lamp exam with Seidel test for bleb leak, gonioscopy to look for cyclodialysis, fundus exam/ultrasound to assess for choroidal effusion or retinal detachment, and refraction/axial length measurement if vision changes. Review initial treatments: conservative measures (cycloplegia, topical steroids as indicated), discontinuation of aqueous suppressants, and observation for mild cases. Explain procedures that may be used if hypotony persists: autologous blood patch, bandage contact lens, bleb compression sutures, or surgical revision/resuturing of the scleral flap. Advise on expected course: many mild cases improve with conservative care; persistent or severe hypotony may require surgery but often can be corrected with good visual recovery. Encourage adherence to follow‑up appointments and to contact the clinic immediately for new or worsening vision changes.


CASE 27 — PosttrabeculectomyWound Leak
======================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Dramatic decrease in vision in the right eye five months after trabeculectomy
DURATION: 5 months
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 59-year-old woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma underwent a limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye; five months postoperatively she presented with a dramatic decrease in vision in the right eye, best-corrected visual acuity 20/100 OD, 20/30 OS, a very shallow anterior chamber OD and intraocular pressure 2 mm Hg.
History Narrative: A 59-year-old woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma underwent a limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye. The scleral flap was closed with two 10–0 nylon sutures; Tenon’s capsule was closed with a running locking 8–0 Vicryl suture, and the conjunctiva was closed with a running, nonlocking 8–0 dissolvable suture. Five months postoperatively she presented with a dramatic decrease in vision in the right eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left. The right anterior chamber was very shallow and intraocular pressure was 2 mm Hg.
Symptom Onset: 5 months postoperative
Symptom Duration: 5 months
Progression: Late Postoperative (Greater than 4 Weeks)
Characteristics: Late bleb leak: cystic, thin-walled, avascular filtering bleb associated with chronic hypotony


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: Aqueous suppression (withholding topical corticosteroids) and use of pressure patch, Simmons shell or oversized bandage contact lens, and topical/systemic corticosteroids reserved for choroidal effusions
Associated Symptoms: Dramatic decrease in vision in the right eye; very shallow anterior chamber; hypotony (IOP 2 mm Hg)
Prior Treatments: Trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C (limbus‑based)
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant — marked reduction in vision (20/100 OD), shallow anterior chamber and hypotony causing dramatic vision decrease, likely substantially impairing daily activities.
Systemic Symptoms: None

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Late bleb leak with chronic hypotony (IOP 2 mm Hg) and shallow/flat anterior chamber in the right eye following mitomycin-C–augmented trabeculectomy, causing marked visual decline (BCVA 20/100) and risk of hypotony maculopathy — recommend initial aqueous suppression/observation with protective measures (bandage contact lens/Simmons shell), consider autologous blood injection or laser therapies as temporizing measures, and plan definitive surgical bleb revision/resurfacing (conjunctival advancement or grafting, patch graft) to eliminate the leak and restore IOP.
Primary Diagnosis: Late bleb leak
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypotony maculopathy Avascular/cystic thin-walled filtering bleb Choroidal effusion (ransient possible)
Differential Diagnosis: Late bleb leak; Chronic hypotony from overfiltration; Choroidal effusion with hypotony
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: hypotony, shallow/flat anterior chamber, hypotony maculopathy, choroidal effusion, cataract, corneal decompensation, synechiae, macular edema, blebitis/endophthalmitis


Plan
All Medications: mitomycin C 10–0 nylon 8–0 Vicryl (dissolvable suture) topical corticosteroids topical aqueous suppressants systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors topical phenylephrine beta-blockers topical or systemic corticosteroids
All Procedures: limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C application; scleral flap closure with two 10–0 nylon sutures; Tenon’s capsule closure with running locking 8–0 Vicryl suture; conjunctival closure with running nonlocking 8–0 dissolvable suture; Seidel test; slit-lamp examination with fluorescein; pressure patching; aqueous suppression; application of Simmons shell or oversized bandage contact lens; argon laser suture lysis (sequential suture release); scleral flap resuturing/bleb revision; autologous blood injection into bleb/subconjunctival tissue; argon laser treatment of conjunctiva; continuous-wave Nd:YAG laser treatment; compression sutures; cryotherapy; Nd:YAG/argon laser reshaping; injection of autologous blood for bleb size reduction; needle revision of bleb; surgical drainage of choroidal effusion; excision of bleb with conjunctival advancement; bleb revision with autologous conjunctival graft; patch grafting over ostium/sclera (corneal, amniotic membrane, or scleral graft); Tenon’s capsule pedicle plug; conjunctival glue; rotational conjunctival-Tenon’s flap graft; free conjunctival patching over ischemic blebs
Follow-Up Instructions: Once the leak is closed, follow closely for recurrent leaks if an ischemic bleb remains; if definitive surgical intervention was successful the bleb will no longer be ischemic and risk of recurrence will be low.
Patient Education: Explain that the sudden drop in vision and very low eye pressure are due to a leak from the glaucoma surgery (a late bleb leak) causing a shallow anterior chamber and hypotony, which can damage the eye if not treated. Initial care often includes stopping pressure-lowering drops, using measures to reduce aqueous production, and protecting the eye (pressure patch, bandage contact lens or Simmons shell) while watching closely. If the leak does not stop or the bleb is thin/ischemic, a procedure will be needed to repair or resurface the bleb (options include autologous blood injection, laser treatments, or surgical revision/patch graft). Emphasize the importance of prompt follow-up, reporting worsening vision, pain, discharge or redness immediately (risk of infection/blebitis), and that definitive repair typically prevents recurrence and preserves vision.


CASE 28 — Failing Filtering Bleb
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Failing filtering bleb
DURATION: 15 months
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 53-year-old African American woman with advanced primary open‑angle glaucoma s/p limbus‑based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye; at 1‑year postop IOP at target with a moderately elevated diffuse ischemic bleb with microcysts, and three months later presented with IOP of 28 mm Hg, deep anterior chamber, and an almost flat filtering bleb.
History Narrative: A 53-year-old African American woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma and a target intraocular pressure of 15 mm Hg underwent a limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye. At 1 year postoperatively she had a moderately elevated diffuse ischemic bleb with microcysts and IOP at target. Three months later she presented with a deep anterior chamber but an almost flat filtering bleb and an elevated IOP of 28 mm Hg, consistent with late filtration failure.
Symptom Onset: 3 months after the 1-year postoperative visit (i.e., at 15 months post-op)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Late filtration failure: elevated IOP (28 mm Hg) one year after trabeculectomy with a flat, low, heavily vascularized filtering bleb and deep anterior chamber suggesting episcleral/bleb fibrosis or sclerostomy obstruction rather than encapsulation.
Primary Diagnosis: Late filtration failure
Secondary Diagnoses: Advanced primary open-angle glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Encapsulated filtering bleb (Tenon’s cyst); Tight scleral flap sutures; Occlusion of the internal sclerostomy (tissue incarceration); Episcleral/bleb fibrosis (ring of steel)
Severity: Late filtration failure.
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: mitomycin C; topical anti-inflammatory agents; IOP-lowering medication
All Procedures: limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C; slit-lamp exam; gonioscopy; ultrasound biomicroscopy; anterior segment optical coherence tomography; argon laser suture lysis; releasable suture release; needle revision of bleb; surgical bleb revision (more aggressive revision)
Follow-Up Instructions: Once IOP is controlled, follow closely for signs of recurrent failure; continue IOP-lowering medication as needed to maintain target IOP.
Patient Education: You have a late failed trabeculectomy (the drainage bleb has become flat and your eye pressure is high). Causes include scarring of the bleb or blockage of the internal opening. Next steps: your doctor will examine the eye (slit lamp and gonioscopy; sometimes imaging) and may first try less invasive measures such as needling of the bleb or medications; if those fail, surgical revision may be recommended. Close follow-up is needed to monitor eye pressure and vision. You may need glaucoma drops long-term even after revision. Report worsening vision, increasing pain, redness, or sudden large changes in vision or eye pressure right away.


CASE 29 — Flat Anterior Chamber
===============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shallow anterior chamber in the right eye 1 day after trabeculectomy
DURATION: 1 day
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 53-year-old woman with bilateral chronic angle-closure glaucoma who presented 1 day after a mitomycin trabeculectomy with a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye; vision 20/400 OD, IOP 34 mm Hg OD; reports acute postoperative central and peripheral anterior chamber shallowing with iridocorneal contact to within 1 mm of the pupillary margin and anterior chamber cells 3+; no bleb leak; patent surgical iridectomy.
History Narrative: A 53-year-old woman with a history of bilateral chronic angle-closure glaucoma developed a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye 1 day after mitomycin trabeculectomy. She reported decreased vision; exam showed VA 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS, IOP 34 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a moderately elevated, Seidel-negative filtration bleb, a shallow anterior chamber with iridocorneal contact from the periphery to within 1 mm of the pupillary margin and central shallowing with a posterior chamber IOL located 0.5 mm posterior to the corneal endothelium, and 3+ anterior chamber cells. A surgical peripheral iridectomy was present and patent with visible ciliary processes. Fundus view was poor but red reflex present OD; B-scan showed a flat retina and no choroidal effusions. Left eye had a filtration bleb, deep anterior chamber, patent iridectomy, and pseudophakia. These findings led to a diagnosis of aqueous misdirection (ciliary block) in the right eye.
Symptom Onset: 1 day after trabeculectomy

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Aqueous misdirection (ciliary block/malignant glaucoma) of the right eye presenting with centrally and peripherally shallow anterior chamber after mitomycin trabeculectomy. Findings supporting diagnosis: patent peripheral surgical iridectomy with visible anteriorly rotated ciliary processes, no bleb leak, IOP elevated at 34 mm Hg, absence of choroidal effusion or hemorrhage on fundus exam and B-scan, posterior chamber IOL displaced 0.5 mm posterior to corneal endothelium, and marked anterior chamber inflammation (3+ cells). Initial management initiated with cycloplegics (atropine/phenylephrine), topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; consider osmotic therapy, Nd:YAG disruption of anterior hyaloid or argon ciliary process treatment if medical therapy fails, and pars plana vitrectomy with anterior hyaloid removal if refractory. Continued cycloplegia long-term may be required; monitor IOP and anterior chamber depth closely.
Primary Diagnosis: Aqueous misdirection
Secondary Diagnoses: Chronic angle-closure glaucoma (bilateral)
Differential Diagnosis: Overfiltration; Choroidal effusion; Pupillary block; Aqueous misdirection
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Aqueous misdirection (malignant glaucoma) leading to a flat/shallow anterior chamber with markedly reduced vision (20/400), elevated IOP (34 mm Hg), corneal–IOL touch (anterior chamber depth reduced with IOL 0.5 mm posterior to endothelium), persistent anterior chamber inflammation (3+ cells), and potential need for laser or surgical vitrectomy (risk of recurrence and long-term cycloplegic dependence)


Plan
All Medications: atropine 1%; phenylephrine 2.5%; topical aqueous suppressants; oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; oral or intravenous osmotic agent; miotics (to be avoided); intracameral viscoelastic
All Procedures: mitomycin trabeculectomy surgical iridectomy/iridectomy confirmation Seidel test (bleb leak testing with fluorescein) B-scan ultrasonography Nd:YAG laser disruption of anterior hyaloid face/posterior capsule Argon laser cyclophotocoagulation (shrinkage of ciliary processes) Intracameral viscoelastic injection (anterior chamber reformation) Pars plana vitrectomy with anterior hyaloid and anterior vitreous removal (core vitrectomy; possible extension to zonules/capsule near iridectomy) sclerotomy placement near iridectomy cycloplegic therapy (atropine 1% instillation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Maintain cycloplegia (eg, atropine 1% daily) potentially indefinitely; avoid miotics; monitor IOP and anterior chamber depth regularly; if vitrectomy performed, reassess need for ongoing cycloplegia (may stop cautiously in pseudophakic eyes); in fellow eye, perform prophylactic laser iridotomy and anticipate/monitor for aqueous misdirection with future surgery.
Patient Education: Aqueous misdirection (ciliary-block or “malignant” glaucoma) is a rare postoperative complication in which fluid is diverted behind the vitreous, pushing the lens–iris forward and causing a uniformly shallow anterior chamber and often high eye pressure. Immediate treatment is important. Initial therapy is medical: eye drops to dilate and relax the eye (cycloplegics such as atropine), medications to decrease eye fluid production (topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), and sometimes oral or IV osmotics. Miotic drops (which constrict the pupil) should be avoided. If medicines and laser (to disrupt the anterior hyaloid or shrink ciliary processes) do not work, surgery (pars plana vitrectomy with anterior hyaloid disruption) is often required to reestablish normal fluid flow. After resolution, long-term dilating drops may be needed to prevent recurrence; avoid miotics in both eyes and discuss prophylactic laser iridotomy for the fellow eye. Seek urgent ophthalmic care if vision worsens, the eye becomes more painful, or symptoms of elevated pressure occur.

Plan
All Medications: Doxycycline
All Procedures: Fundus photography; Fluorescein angiography; Magnified fundus examination with contact lens; Fundus contact lens examination (posterior pole/macular evaluation); Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) — indicated if unexplained vision loss or to assess macular edema; Panretinal (scatter) laser photocoagulation — consideration for severe NPDR per ETDRS.
Follow-Up Instructions: Annual examination for minimal/absent NPDR; every 6–12 months for mild–moderate NPDR without macular edema; every 4–6 months if nonclinically significant edema is present; every 1–2 months for clinically significant macular edema; every 2–4 months for severe or very severe NPDR.
Patient Education: Educate patient about diabetic retinopathy: importance of strict blood glucose and blood pressure control to reduce progression risk; recognize symptoms (blurred vision) and report changes promptly; need for regular ophthalmic follow-up (every 4–12 months depending on severity; for his moderately severe NPDR—follow‑up every 2–4 months is suggested as he approaches severe NPDR); explanation of tests used (fundus exam, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, OCT when indicated); discuss treatment options if progression occurs (panretinal scatter laser for severe NPDR/proliferative disease, possible intravitreal therapy for macular edema) and lifestyle measures (smoking cessation, lipid control); encourage coordination with primary care/endocrinologist for systemic risk factor management.


CASE 32 — Diabetic Macular Edema
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: blurred vision of several weeks’ duration
DURATION: several weeks
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I've been having blurred vision for several weeks."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 58-year-old man with 20-year history of type I diabetes who developed several weeks of blurred vision; has recent-onset hypertension and chronic hypercholesterolemia.
History Narrative: A 58-year-old man with a 20-year history of type I diabetes, recent-onset hypertension, and chronic hypercholesterolemia presented with several weeks of blurred vision. Examination revealed best corrected visual acuity 20/30 OU, no afferent pupillary defect, trace nuclear lens opacity, and intraocular pressures of 20 mmHg OU. Fundus exam showed moderate microaneurysms in all quadrants bilaterally and clinically significant diabetic macular edema with a circinate lipid ring surrounding the macular center in the right eye; the left eye had similar microaneurysms and macular edema plus early neovascularization at the disc. Fluorescein angiography confirmed macular leakage OU and NVD in the left eye; OCT confirmed macular edema OU. He underwent bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for macular edema, was scheduled for 1-month follow-up to reassess the left eye NVD and need for repeat anti-VEGF, returned 1 month after the second injection, and underwent a third anti-VEGF injection and focal laser in the right eye for unresolved edema; the left eye at that visit had 20/20 vision, normal macular contours on OCT, and required no further treatment.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 58-year-old man with 20-year type I diabetes, recent hypertension and chronic hypercholesterolemia, presenting with blurred vision for several weeks. Exam: BCVA 20/30 OU, IOP 20 OU, trace nuclear sclerosis, no RAPD. Fundus: moderate scattered microaneurysms OU; clinically significant, center-involving diabetic macular edema OU with circinate lipid ring in OD; early neovascularization of the disc (NVD) in OS. FA confirmed macular leakage OU and NVD OS. OCT confirmed macular edema OU. Assessment: Clinically significant, center‑involving diabetic macular edema OU; early proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NVD) OS. Plan: initiate intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy OU with interval follow‑up in 4–6 weeks; repeat injections as needed (typical loading of three monthly injections) and consider focal laser to OD for persistent edema; defer further PRP for OS pending response to anti‑VEGF unless progression warrants PRP; optimize systemic control (BP, lipids, glycemia) and monitor closely for treatment response.
Primary Diagnosis: Clinically significant diabetic macular edema, center-involving (ci-CSME) OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Type I diabetes mellitus (20-year history); systemic hypertension (recent-onset); chronic hypercholesterolemia; early proliferative diabetic retinopathy OS
Differential Diagnosis: Clinically significant diabetic macular edema (DME); Hypertensive retinopathy with macular edema; Cystoid macular edema (postoperative); Radiation retinopathy
Severity: Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (OD); Early proliferative diabetic retinopathy (OS)
Laterality: OU


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab ranibizumab aflibercept intravitreal corticosteroids argon (laser — not a medication)
All Procedures: Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections OU (three injections planned/administrated); focal laser treatment OD; fluorescein angiography; optical coherence tomography (OCT); slit-lamp examination; funduscopic examination; intraocular pressure measurement.
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in 4–6 weeks for clinical and OCT re-evaluation; if persistent edema or visual loss, retreat with anti‑VEGF (repeat injections at 4–6 week intervals, consider a sequence of 3 before switching), consider focal/grid laser if unresolved (or intravitreal steroid for poor responders/pseudophakic eyes), and monitor/reevaluate earlier if progression of neovascularization—coordinate systemic optimization (BP, lipids, glucose) and consider PRP if proliferative disease progresses.
Patient Education: This is diabetic macular edema (DME), a swelling of the central retina from long-standing diabetes. Treatment aims to reduce swelling and preserve vision and usually involves injections into the eye of anti-VEGF medications (monthly to start) and sometimes focal laser. Good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol improves outcomes. You will need regular follow-up with OCT imaging every 4–6 weeks initially to monitor response; a series of three injections is commonly tried before changing therapy. If injections fail, options include switching anti-VEGF agents, steroid injections (usually for pseudophakic eyes or if pressure is controlled), or rarely surgery for tractional causes. Prompt treatment is recommended for center-involving DME to prevent vision loss. Notify your doctor for new floaters, sudden decrease in vision, pain, or redness after injections.
Referrals: Medical consultation for optimization of systemic conditions (control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia)
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate care for sudden severe vision loss, new flashes or many new floaters, sudden eye pain, or signs of infection after an injection (increasing redness, worsening pain, discharge, or fever). If any of these occur, go to the emergency department or contact the ophthalmology clinic immediately.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy with high-risk characteristics — neovascularization of the disc exceeding one disc area, elevated frond without vitreous hemorrhage. Left eye: Moderately severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with intraretinal hemorrhages and microaneurysms in all four quadrants (hemorrhages exceeding standard photograph 2A in two quadrants), no macular thickening and no vitreous hemorrhage. Visual acuity 20/20 OU, IOP 12 OD / 13 OS, clear lenses. Recommend prompt panretinal photocoagulation for the right eye (consider staging and possible retrobulbar anesthesia for comfort) and close observation/management for the left eye with routine surveillance and treatment of macular edema if it develops; consider adjunctive anti-VEGF if vitreous hemorrhage or macular edema present.
Primary Diagnosis: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
Secondary Diagnoses: Type II diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy (proliferative vs nonproliferative); Branch or central retinal vein occlusion with collateral vessels; Proliferative sickle retinopathy; Radiation or hypertensive retinopathy
Severity: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy with high-risk characteristics
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Pain in the immediate posttreatment period - Vitreous hemorrhage - Decreased night vision (diminished illumination) - Peripheral visual field loss - Exacerbation of diabetic macular edema - Early persistent visual loss (≥2 lines)


Plan
All Procedures: Panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP); Fluorescein angiography (diagnostic); Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT); Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection; Vitrectomy (for vitreous hemorrhage/tractional retinal detachment)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe within a few weeks after completing PRP; if retinopathy progresses consider vitrectomy; if regressed, continue conservative observational follow-up contingent on stability of retinopathy and visual acuity; consider repeat PRP and/or anti‑VEGF for recurrent vitreous hemorrhages or incomplete regression of neovascularization.
Patient Education: You have diabetic retinopathy. The right eye has proliferative disease (abnormal new blood vessels) that puts you at higher risk for vision loss; the left eye has moderately severe nonproliferative disease. You may have no symptoms now, so regular dilated eye exams are essential. Treatments reduce the risk of severe vision loss: panretinal laser (PRP) is the standard for proliferative disease; intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are often used, especially if there is macular swelling or bleeding that prevents laser. PRP is usually done over multiple short sessions and can cause transient pain, decreased night vision, and sometimes temporary worsening of macular edema. Anti‑VEGF injections can shrink neovascularization and help with macular edema. If bleeding into the vitreous or traction threatens the macula, vitrectomy surgery may be needed. Tight control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol reduces progression. Report any new vision loss, floaters, flashes, or sudden obscuration of vision immediately. Follow-up visits will include dilated exam, photographs, and OCT; fluorescein angiography only if needed.


CASE 34 — Retinal Arterial Occlusion
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: sudden visual loss in the right eye 4 weeks earlier
DURATION: 4 weeks
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 69-year-old woman presented 4 weeks after sudden visual loss in the right eye. She has a 6‑year history of systemic hypertension and 1‑year history of diabetes mellitus. At presentation visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS; no afferent pupillary defect; IOP 16 mm Hg OU. Slit‑lamp notable only for early nuclear sclerosis OU. Fundus OD showed an inferotemporal retinal artery sclerotic and attenuated with a glistening yellow cholesterol (Hollenhorst) plaque proximally and an area of superficial retinal whitening in the posterior pole along the obstructed artery’s distribution; OS fundus normal. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a corresponding filling defect in the inferior branch retinal artery distribution.
History Narrative: A 69-year-old woman presented 4 weeks after sudden visual loss in the right eye. Medical history included a 6-year history of systemic hypertension and a 1-year history of diabetes mellitus. Examination showed visual acuity of 20/30 and 20/25 in the right and left eyes, respectively. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressures were 16 mm Hg in each eye. Slit-lamp examination was remarkable only for early nuclear sclerosis of the lens in both eyes. On funduscopic examination of the right eye, the inferotemporal retinal artery appeared sclerotic and attenuated with a glistening yellow cholesterol embolus (Hollenhorst’s plaque) at its proximal part. There was an area of superficial retinal whitening, most prominent in the posterior pole along the distribution of the obstructed artery. Funduscopic examination of the left eye was normal. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a corresponding filling defect in the inferior branch retinal artery distribution.
Symptom Onset: 4 weeks after sudden visual loss
Symptom Duration: 4 weeks
Characteristics: Sudden, dense loss of vision corresponding to a zone of retinal whitening and arterial attenuation, often with a Hollenhorst (cholesterol) plaque; retinal whitening (edema) transient; sectoral/hemifield visual field defect respecting horizontal midline.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), right eye — inferotemporal branch with Hollenhorst cholesterol embolus and corresponding retinal whitening; vision relatively preserved (20/30 OD), no afferent pupillary defect. Associated systemic vascular risk factors: hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Recommend systemic vascular workup (carotid evaluation, ECG/echocardiography) and close ophthalmic follow-up to monitor for neovascularization.
Primary Diagnosis: Branch retinal artery occlusion, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Central retinal artery occlusion; Branch retinal artery occlusion; Ophthalmic artery occlusion
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Retinal neovascularization (including possible iris neovascularization/rubeosis iridis)


Plan
All Medications: intravenous acetazolamide
All Procedures: Intravenous fluorescein angiography; slit-lamp biomicroscopy/indirect ophthalmoscopy exam; digital ocular massage (described as digital pressure on globe); lowering IOP measures (IV acetazolamide, topical IOP-lowering drops, anterior chamber paracentesis); inhalation of carbogen (5% CO2/95% O2) (advocated); retrobulbar or systemic calcium channel blocker administration (advocated); panretinal photocoagulation (for neovascularization)
Follow-Up Instructions: Monitor for subsequent neovascularization with periodic ophthalmic exams; reinforce and coordinate systemic vascular risk management with the patient’s internist (carotid evaluation, ECG/echocardiography as indicated).
Patient Education: You have a blockage in a retinal artery (branch retinal artery occlusion) causing sudden vision loss in the right eye. This is most often due to an embolus from atherosclerotic blood vessels and is a warning sign for systemic vascular disease. Important points: - Visual prognosis: many eyes with BRAO improve; about 80% recover to 20/40 or better, but some vision loss may be permanent. - Urgent systemic evaluation: you should see your primary care doctor or internist for cardiovascular risk assessment (blood pressure and diabetes control), carotid artery evaluation (e.g., Doppler), electrocardiogram, and possibly echocardiography to search for embolic sources. - Eye treatments: no proven therapy reliably restores vision; in very recent occlusions (within 24 hours) maneuvers to lower intraocular pressure (medications or paracentesis) or ocular massage are sometimes attempted. Fibrinolytic or other interventions are rarely used and have limited benefit. - Follow-up: return for regular eye exams to monitor for complications, especially retinal or iris neovascularization, which may need laser treatment. If you have diabetes or other vascular disease, close coordination with your doctors is essential. - Risk reduction: control blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, stop smoking, and follow prescribed cardiac/carotid treatments to reduce risk of stroke or heart attack. If you develop sudden new vision loss, eye pain, or flashes, seek immediate care.
Referrals: Internist (for systemic vascular workup including carotid evaluation and cardiac evaluation)
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate medical evaluation for sudden vision loss; if within 24 hours, attempts to dislodge an embolus may be tried (ocular massage, lowering IOP with IV acetazolamide/topical drops or anterior chamber paracentesis), and urgent systemic workup (carotid evaluation, ECG, echocardiogram, management of hypertension/diabetes) is needed to reduce stroke/MI risk.

Funduscopic exam OS showed an anomalous arteriovenous crossing along the inferotemporal arcade with dot-and-blot hemorrhages extending from the midportion of the inferotemporal arcade posteriorly into the macula and moderate to marked macular edema; a branch retinal vein occlusion was diagnosed. Intravitreal bevacizumab was given without improvement, then aflibercept was started and administered approximately every 6 weeks for about a year with better effect, stabilizing vision OS at 20/70.
Symptom Onset: 2 months
Symptom Duration: 2 months
Progression: Progressive stabilization with persistent macular edema managed by ongoing intravitreal anti-VEGF every 6 weeks leading to vision stabilized at 20/70.
Characteristics: Segmental intraretinal hemorrhages and macular edema in the distribution of the inferotemporal branch retinal vein with anomalous arteriovenous crossing; central scotoma superotemporal; collateral vessels possible; variable neovascularization risk.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: BRVO with macular edema, OS — 66‑year‑old man with 2‑month history of decreased vision OS (central scotoma superotemporal); inferotemporal BRVO with dot‑and‑blot hemorrhages extending into the macula and moderate–marked macular edema on OCT; history of well‑controlled hypertension; prior CRVO OD treated with anti‑VEGF and intravitreal triamcinolone with improvement to 20/80 OD. Vision OS initially 20/200, stabilized at 20/70 with intravitreal bevacizumab then aflibercept q6 weeks for ~1 year. IOP 15 mmHg OU. No retinal neovascularization or vitreous hemorrhage noted; collateral vessels OD. Management: ongoing intravitreal anti‑VEGF (aflibercept) for macular edema with OCT monitoring; consider sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation if neovascularization develops; systemic BP optimization recommended; surgical interventions reserved for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or tractional complications.
Primary Diagnosis: BRVO with macular edema, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension (well controlled)
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy; Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO); Radiation retinopathy; Sickle cell retinopathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: macular edema; intraretinal hemorrhages; retinal neovascularization; vitreous hemorrhage; fibrovascular proliferation leading to tractional/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; epiretinal membrane; decreased visual acuity (vision loss)


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab; aflibercept; intravitreal triamcinolone; aspirin
All Procedures: intravitreal bevacizumab injections intravitreal aflibercept injections intravitreal triamcinolone injections sectoral (scatter) laser photocoagulation focal/grid macular laser photocoagulation fluorescein angiography optical coherence tomography (OCT) fundus photography vitrectomy with membrane peeling vitrectomy for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or tractional/rhegmatogenous RD
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow every 3–6 months initially if vision >20/32; if macular edema causing visual loss, begin intravitreal therapy (typically every 4–6 weeks initially) and extend interval per response; perform OCT monitoring to guide retreatment; apply sectoral scatter photocoagulation if retinal neovascularization develops; consider vitrectomy for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or tractional/rhegmatogenous macular detachment.
Patient Education: Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a blockage of a small retinal vein causing retinal hemorrhages and swelling (macular edema) that can reduce central vision. Common risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, glaucoma, and smoking — controlling these reduces further risk. Vision loss from BRVO is often treatable: focal or sectoral laser can prevent neovascular complications; intravitreal injections (anti-VEGF agents or corticosteroids) are now the main treatment for macular edema and frequently improve or stabilize vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and sometimes fluorescein angiography are used to monitor retinal swelling and ischemia and to guide treatment frequency. Follow-up is typically every 4–12 weeks depending on activity; promptly report new floaters, sudden vision loss, or increased blurring which may signal vitreous hemorrhage or retinal complications. Discuss systemic risk-factor management with your primary care physician.
Referrals: Notify patient's primary care physician; consider systemic evaluation for younger or bilateral disease; refer for ophthalmic intravitreal therapy and retinal laser/vitrectomy as needed.

====================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: decreased vision in her right eye
DURATION: 4 weeks
LATERALITY: Right eye
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have decreased vision in my right eye."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: An 87-year-old woman with prior nonexudative age-related macular degeneration in both eyes presented with decreased vision in her right eye. Examination showed vision 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS, pseudophakia OU, normal intraocular pressures, and no definite afferent pupillary defect. Fundus exam OD revealed drusen with RPE changes in the macula with new subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment (no hemorrhage); OS had drusen with RPE changes and no hemorrhage. OCT OD confirmed a pigment epithelial detachment with adjacent subretinal fluid; FA OD showed delayed stippled hyperfluorescence with late leakage consistent with an occult CNVM. The patient underwent an intravitreal bevacizumab injection and was instructed to follow up in 4 weeks.
History Narrative: An 87-year-old woman with a prior history of nonexudative age-related macular degeneration in both eyes presented complaining of decreased vision in her right eye. She is pseudophakic bilaterally. There was no definite afferent pupillary defect and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS. Funduscopic exam OD showed drusen with retinal pigment epithelium changes in the macula with new subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment; no hemorrhage was noted. OS showed drusen with RPE changes in the macula and no hemorrhage. OCT OD showed a pigment epithelial detachment with adjacent subretinal fluid; OS showed drusen with no macular fluid. Fluorescein angiography OD demonstrated delayed stippled hyperfluorescence with late leakage consistent with an occult choroidal neovascular membrane. The patient underwent an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and was instructed to follow up in 4 weeks.
Progression: Converted from nonexudative to exudative AMD (new conversion to exudative disease)
Characteristics: Hemorrhage and exudation of fluid or exudate into the intraretinal, subretinal, and sub‑RPE spaces (with drusen and RPE atrophic changes), often with pigment epithelial detachment and subretinal fluid due to choroidal neovascularization.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: Decreased central vision and metamorphopsia
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — decreased central vision and metamorphopsia impair tasks requiring fine detail (reading, recognizing faces, driving), but peripheral vision likely preserved allowing some independence.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Occult choroidal neovascularization with subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment secondary to conversion to exudative age-related macular degeneration in the right eye; nonexudative AMD with drusen and RPE changes in the left eye without macular fluid.
Primary Diagnosis: Occult choroidal neovascularization with subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment secondary to exudative age-related macular degeneration (right eye)
Secondary Diagnoses: Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (fellow eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Exudative (neovascular) AMD secondary CNV; Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome with CNV; Myopic degeneration–associated CNV; Idiopathic choroidal neovascularization
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Intraretinal, subretinal, and sub–retinal pigment epithelial fluid/exudation; pigment epithelial detachment; conversion from nonexudative to exudative AMD with occult choroidal neovascular membrane leading to potential persistent or recurrent macular fluid, subretinal hemorrhage, and progressive central vision loss requiring long-term repetitive intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, pegaptanib
All Procedures: Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in 4 weeks for re-evaluation and repeat OCT (and treat with further intravitreal anti-VEGF as indicated).
Patient Education: Explain that their decreased vision is due to conversion of dry (nonexudative) AMD to wet (exudative) AMD caused by abnormal new blood vessels (CNVM) leaking fluid under the retina and under the RPE. Describe that OCT and fluorescein angiography confirm fluid and occult CNVM. Discuss that the standard, effective treatment is intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (e.g., bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept), that they received an injection today and will need close follow-up (typically in 4 weeks) for repeated injections as needed or per a treat-and-extend schedule. Advise to monitor vision at home (Amsler grid) and report sudden worsening, new distortion, or increased floater/flash/eye pain immediately. Review injection risks (infection, increased eye pressure, retinal detachment, inflammation) and expected side effects (mild soreness, redness). Discuss low-vision aids and rehabilitation options if vision loss persists.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization and recurrence secondary to myopic degeneration, OU.
Primary Diagnosis: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization and recurrence secondary to myopic degeneration, OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Myopic degeneration (pathologic myopia) with choroidal neovascularization; glaucoma; retinal lattice degeneration
Differential Diagnosis: Pathologic myopia with choroidal neovascular membrane (myopic CNVM); Age-related macular degeneration with CNV; Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome with CNV; Traumatic choroidal rupture with secondary CNV
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Choroidal neovascularization (CNVM) leading to subretinal hemorrhage and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy with vision loss - Recurrence of CNVM - Progressive geographic RPE atrophy enlarging central scotoma - Retinal lattice degeneration (risk for retinal detachment) - Posterior staphyloma/myopic structural changes (tilted disc, lacquer cracks) - Glaucoma (on topical therapy)


Plan
All Medications: Propine, topical beta‑blocker, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, verteporfin
All Procedures: Argon blue-green laser photocoagulation OS; krypton laser photocoagulation OS
Follow-Up Instructions: - Follow-up 4 weeks after initial anti-VEGF treatment for CNVM; thereafter extend interval based on response and stability. - Perform OCT at each visit to detect subclinical CNVM or macular schisis. - For nonexudative disease, follow up twice yearly. - Monitor central vision daily with an Amsler grid and seek ophthalmologic evaluation promptly for new distortion or central metamorphopsia.
Patient Education: - Myopic degeneration is a complication of high myopia that can cause central vision loss either from atrophy or from abnormal new blood vessels (choroidal neovascularization, CNVM). - Monitor vision daily with an Amsler grid and report new distortion, blurring, or a central blind spot promptly. - Treatment for CNVM is primarily intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (e.g., ranibizumab/bevacizumab); follow-up typically 4 weeks after initial treatment and then individualized. - Not all lesions are treatable with laser; some prior therapies (laser, PDT) have limitations compared with anti-VEGF. - Regular follow-up (about twice yearly for nonexudative disease; more frequent after CNVM) with OCT and eye exams is important to detect recurrence or progression. - Low-vision aids (magnifiers, high-plus lenses, telescopes, video magnification) can help when central vision is reduced. - Protect eyes and discuss glaucoma and peripheral retinal issues with your ophthalmologist; report flashes, new floaters, or curtain-like vision immediately.

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Within normal limits


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 35-year-old male with acute idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) of the left eye. Presented with 3 weeks of decreased vision and central metamorphopsia; VA OS 20/50 improving to 20/30 with +2.00, IOPs and anterior segments normal. Dilated exam OS showed a circumscribed neurosensory macular detachment without hemorrhage, exudate, or retinal tear. OCT OS demonstrated subretinal fluid under the fovea; FA OS showed expanding focal leakage (“inkblot” pattern). No systemic steroid use or other precipitating factors identified. Managed conservatively with close observation; subretinal fluid resolved and VA returned to 20/20 in one month. Plan: continued observation, counsel regarding recurrence risk and steroid avoidance; consider photodynamic therapy or focal laser if fluid persists or recurs.
Primary Diagnosis: Central serous chorioretinopathy
Differential Diagnosis: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR); Choroidal neovascular membrane (exudative AMD or PCV); Posterior segment inflammation with serous retinal detachment (Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada, posterior scleritis); Neoplastic or infiltrative choroidal lesions (choroidal melanoma, metastasis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: scotomas; subretinal neovascularization; expansion of laser burns


Plan
All Medications: +2.00 (spectacle lens) Corticosteroids Psychotropic medications Rifampin Methotrexate Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Metoprolol Propranolol Ketoconazole Mifepristone Eplerenone Spironolactone Finasteride Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents
All Procedures: Observation (close monitoring)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe closely; most resolve within 3 months with repeat clinical exam and OCT monitoring. If subretinal fluid persists or vision worsens after ~3 months (or earlier for occupational needs), consider treatment (e.g., focal laser or photodynamic therapy). Monitor for recurrence and check the fellow eye; counsel to avoid corticosteroids and address modifiable risk factors.
Patient Education: Your condition, central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), is caused by fluid collecting under the retina, which can blur or distort central vision. Most cases improve on their own within about 3 months. Important points: - Avoid or stop systemic corticosteroids if possible, because steroids can worsen CSCR. - Reduce stress and address any contributing medications or conditions with your doctor. - Expect regular follow-up with OCT/eye exams to monitor the subretinal fluid; many patients recover good vision. - If fluid persists or is chronic, treatments such as focal laser or photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be recommended to speed resolution. - CSCR can recur and may affect the other eye; report any new blurring, distortion, or changes promptly.
Emergency Instructions: Seek urgent ophthalmic care if you develop sudden worsening of vision, new flashes or many new floaters, severe eye pain, or signs of infection (redness, discharge, fever). If on systemic corticosteroids, stop and contact your prescribing clinician immediately. For sudden, severe changes go to the emergency department or retina specialist promptly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: ERM secondary to previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment, right eye. 73-year-old woman with 18-month progressive decline in vision and metamorphopsia; preoperative BCVA 20/200 with prominent epiretinal membrane and foveal contour distortion on OCT. Underwent pars plana vitrectomy with ERM peel; by 3 months post-op BCVA improved to 20/60, metamorphopsia markedly improved, clinical exam and OCT show no recurrent ERM with decreased foveal thickness and improved foveal contour. Continued routine postoperative topical steroid and antibiotic; monitor for cataract progression and rare recurrence.
Primary Diagnosis: ERM secondary to previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Retinal detachment repaired (prior), peripheral retinal break
Differential Diagnosis: Cystoid macular edema; Vitreomacular traction; Hypotony-related retinal/choroidal folds; Secondary epiretinal membrane from prior retinal break/detachment
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: retinal detachment; progressive nuclear sclerosis (cataract formation)


Plan
All Medications: topical corticosteroid drops; topical antibiotic drops
All Procedures: Pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel (with internal limiting membrane peel performed/possible)
Follow-Up Instructions: Topical corticosteroid and antibiotic drops postoperatively; routine clinic follow-up with visual acuity and OCT at ~6 weeks and 3 months (maximal improvement by 3–6 months); monitor for retinal detachment and cataract progression; return sooner for increased floaters, flashes, pain, or sudden vision loss.
Patient Education: - Epiretinal membranes (macular puckers) are a common cause of gradual vision decline and metamorphopsia. - Diagnosis is by clinical exam and optical coherence tomography (OCT), which shows a hyperreflective membrane on the retinal surface and distortion/thickening of the fovea. - If vision is mild and symptoms are minimal, careful observation is appropriate because many membranes stabilize. - Surgery (pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peel, often removing the internal limiting membrane) is recommended for vision typically 20/40–20/60 or worse, or for severe disabling metamorphopsia. - Expected benefits of surgery: many patients experience improved vision and reduced distortion, with most improvement occurring by 3–6 months; this case improved from 20/200 to 20/60 by 3 months. - Risks: overall complication rate is low (<5%); the most common serious complication is retinal detachment. Cataract progression is very likely in phakic eyes after vitrectomy. - Postoperative care includes topical steroid and antibiotic drops; follow-up exams and OCT to monitor recovery and rare recurrence. - If you notice sudden new floaters, flashes, a shadow/curtain over vision, or sudden worsening of vision, contact your eye surgeon immediately.


CASE 42 — Vitreomacular Traction
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye for 3 months, interfering with driving and reading
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: OD
PATIENT QUOTES: "I've had progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in my right eye for three months; it's interfering with my driving and reading."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 78-year-old woman with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye, interfering with driving and reading. Vision 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. Slit-lamp: clear cornea, no cataract; IOP 13 mm Hg OU. Fundus: focal adherent posterior vitreous to the macula with raised retinal tissue OD and nonspecific loss of foveal reflex OS. OCT OD showed posterior hyaloid partially attached to macula with elevation and distortion; OCT OS showed focal vitreomacular attachment with inner foveal layer distortion. Prior intravitreal ocriplasmin injection OD with no improvement after 1 month; subsequently underwent PPV OD with release of VMT and improved foveal contour and vision to 20/30 OD at 1 month. OS observed with stable vision 20/40 and nonprogressive symptoms.
History Narrative: A 78-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye interfering with driving and reading abilities. The vision was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated clear cornea, absence of cataract, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Fundoscopic examination showed focal areas of adherent posterior vitreous to the macula associated with raised retinal tissue, OD, and a nonspecific loss of foveal reflex, OS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in OD demonstrated a hyperreflective layer correspondent to the posterior hyaloid partially attached to the macula, leading to elevation and distortion of the retina. The OCT OS also showed focal vitreomacular attachment with distortion of the inner foveal layers. An intravitreal ocriplasmin injection was performed OD without improvement in vision or OCT appearance after 1 month. A pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed OD with release of the vitreomacular traction and improvement of the foveal contour. The vision was 20/30 OD 1 month postoperatively. The OS has remained unchanged with vision of 20/40 without clinically important or progressive symptoms, so it has been observed.
Symptom Onset: 3 months
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Progressive
Characteristics: Vitreomacular traction with focal posterior hyaloid adhesion causing elevation and distortion of the macula (hyperreflective layer on OCT), associated metamorphopsia and decreased vision; OD progressive symptomatic VMT (required ocriplasmin then PPV) and OS focal nonprogressive VMT.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 1. Vitreomacular traction (VMT) OD with symptomatic progressive vision loss and metamorphopsia — OCT confirms partial posterior hyaloid attachment causing elevation/distortion of the macula; failed intravitreal ocriplasmin; underwent pars plana vitrectomy with release of VMT and improved foveal contour, vision improved to 20/30 OD at 1 month post-op. 2. VMT OS, nonprogressive, minimal symptoms — OCT shows focal vitreomacular attachment with inner foveal layer distortion; being observed with vision 20/40 OS.
Primary Diagnosis: Vitreomacular traction OD
Differential Diagnosis: Vitreomacular traction (VMT); Full-thickness macular hole (FTMH); Epiretinal membrane (ERM)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: dyschromatopsia; electroretinographic changes; ellipsoid layer disruption; cystoid macular edema; foveal neurosensory detachment; lamellar or full-thickness macular hole


Plan
All Medications: ocriplasmin
All Procedures: Intravitreal ocriplasmin injection OD; Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) OD
Follow-Up Instructions: Educate patient to self-monitor with Amsler grid for worsening metamorphopsia, decreased vision, or development of scotoma; periodic clinical evaluations with OCT as indicated.
Patient Education: Educate patient on self-monitoring with Amsler grid for worsening metamorphopsia, decreased vision, or new scotoma; explain that observation is appropriate for minimal symptoms since spontaneous release can occur (especially with focal attachment), but report any progression promptly; discuss treatment options if symptoms worsen — intravitreal ocriplasmin (best for younger phakic eyes without ERM and focal VMT), pars plana vitrectomy for persistent/progressive VMT, and possible intravitreal expansile gas; review risks and benefits of interventions and expected visual outcomes (PPV often stabilizes or improves vision).


CASE 43 — Vitreous Hemorrhage
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: sudden decreased vision in the left eye for 3 months
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 90-year-old woman with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye, with VA initially 2/200 OS, dense vitreous hemorrhage precluding posterior view; no diabetes or hypertension; prior treated subfoveal CNV OS and atrophic AMD OD.
History Narrative: This 90-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye. Her visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 2/200 OS. Intraocular pressures were 12 mm Hg in each eye. Slit-lamp examination showed a well-positioned posterior chamber lens implant on the right with vitreous adherent to the wound superiorly. In the left eye, she had 2+ nuclear sclerosis and a very dense vitreous hemorrhage precluding a view posteriorly. Past ocular history included vision of 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS 3 years earlier due to atrophic age-related macular degeneration OD and a previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane OS. Medical history was negative for diabetes and hypertension. B-scan/A-scan ultrasonography showed vitreous hemorrhage with posterior vitreous detachment OS; no retinal tear or detachment was seen and a disciform scar in the left macula could not be resolved. She was observed without treatment; on follow-up at 3 months visual acuity improved to 20/400 with a visible subfoveal laser scar and contiguous subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the midperiphery.
Symptom Onset: 3 months prior to presentation
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Improved
Characteristics: Dense vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye precluding posterior view; acute sudden decreased vision OS for 3 months; associated posterior vitreous detachment OS; subfoveal laser scar with contiguous subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to midperiphery; no retinal tear or detachment on B-scan; 2+ nuclear sclerosis OS.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and extension of subretinal hemorrhage from choroidal neovascularization (breakthrough bleeding)
Alleviating Factors: Observation/expectant management (no active treatment) and allowing blood to settle inferiorly by head positioning; vision improved over time without intervention.
Associated Symptoms: sudden decreased vision in the left eye
Prior Treatments: previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane (laser) in the left eye
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant impairment—left-eye vision reduced to 2/200 (later 20/400), causing marked difficulty with activities requiring distance and central vision; however, fellow eye with 20/40 provides functional vision for most daily tasks.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: Proliferative retinopathies (eg, proliferative diabetic retinopathy), posterior vitreous detachment with retinal tear risk, branch retinal vein occlusion, sickle cell retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization/age-related macular degeneration, history of trauma (blunt or penetrating), Terson’s syndrome, choroidal melanoma, retinal macroaneurysm, prior ocular surgery (posterior chamber lens implant), advanced age.

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Dense vitreous hemorrhage precluding view of the peripheral retina OS; peripheral retina not visible OS; peripheral retina intact OD to ora serrata.


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Vitreous hemorrhage OS most consistent with breakthrough bleeding from subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (history of treated CNV OS and visible subfoveal laser scar with contiguous subretinal hemorrhage). B-scan ultrasound showed dense vitreous hemorrhage with posterior vitreous detachment OS but no retinal tear or detachment. Visual acuity OS severely reduced (2/200 → 20/400). No history of diabetes or hypertension; fellow eye with atrophic AMD. Given limited visual potential from macular degeneration and improving acuity, observation was chosen with close follow-up; vitrectomy deferred unless hemorrhage fails to clear or bilateral vision worsens.
Primary Diagnosis: Vitreous hemorrhage due to breakthrough bleeding associated with choroidal neovascularization, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Posterior vitreous detachment; Atrophic age-related macular degeneration OD; Previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane OS; Nuclear sclerosis (2+) OS; Posterior chamber lens implant OD
Differential Diagnosis: Breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage from choroidal neovascularization (AMD); Posterior vitreous detachment with retinal tear; Proliferative retinopathies (e.g., proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS


Plan
All Procedures: B-scan/A-scan ultrasonography; Indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression; Observation (clinical follow-up); Laser treatment (when possible); Vitrectomy (for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe with close follow-up; monitor for spontaneous clearing and vision improvement; repeat clinical exams and B‑scan as needed to rule out retinal tear or detachment; consider vitrectomy if hemorrhage fails to clear by 3–6 months or sooner if signs of retinal tear/detachment or loss of visual potential; counsel patient on prognosis and need for prompt return with new symptoms.
Patient Education: You have a vitreous hemorrhage — bleeding into the gel of the eye — most likely from your previously treated macular degeneration. This can cause sudden, marked vision loss and may improve slowly as the blood clears, but sometimes requires treatment. What to expect - Visual recovery can be slow; blood may settle inferiorly and vision often improves somewhat as it clears. - We will monitor closely with repeat eye exams and ultrasound to ensure there is no retinal tear or retinal detachment. Warning signs — seek urgent care if you experience: - A sudden increase in floaters or new flashes of light - A curtain or shadow coming across your vision (possible retinal detachment) - Marked worsening of vision or new pain Tests and follow-up - B‑scan ultrasound is used when the back of the eye cannot be seen to check for retinal tear/detachment. - Frequent follow-up visits are needed (initially within days to weeks, then serially) until the blood clears or a cause is treated. Possible treatments - Observation is common if no tear or detachment and vision is stable; many cases clear over weeks to months. - Laser or injections treat underlying choroidal neovascularization if active. - Vitrectomy (surgical removal of vitreous) may be offered if the hemorrhage does not clear in 3–6 months or sooner if a treatable cause (retinal tear, detachment, or severe proliferation) is found. Practical advice - Sleep with head slightly elevated to allow blood to settle inferiorly and possibly improve your ability to be examined. - Protect the eye from trauma; avoid heavy lifting or activities that raise blood pressure until cleared or advised otherwise. Prognosis - Visual prognosis depends on the underlying cause (e.g., if macular scar from AMD is present, maximal vision may be limited). Good vision in the fellow eye helps overall function.


CASE 44 — Retinitis Pigmentosa
==============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressive visual difficulties at night (nyctalopia) and decreased peripheral vision.
DURATION: Since the age of 10 (14 years)
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have had trouble performing outdoor activities after dusk." "I stopped driving at night, because I no longer felt safe." "For many years, I have been 'clumsy' and often walked into surrounding objects I could not see well."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 24-year-old woman with progressive night vision difficulties since age 10, longstanding nyctalopia and clumsiness with bumping into objects, stopped driving at night one year ago for safety, otherwise healthy, negative family history for ocular problems and no consanguinity.
History Narrative: A 24-year-old woman with progressive visual difficulties at night was evaluated. Since the age of 10, the patient has had trouble performing outdoor activities after dusk. A year ago, the patient stopped driving at night because she no longer felt safe. For many years, the patient has been “clumsy” and often walked into surrounding objects she could not see well. The patient was otherwise healthy. Family history was negative for ocular problems, and there was no consanguinity. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in each eye, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Goldmann visual fields revealed large midperipheral ring-shaped scotomas. Funduscopic examination showed atrophy of the midperipheral and peripheral retina with areas of pigment clumping (“bone spicules”). Attenuation of the retinal vasculature in the area of retinal atrophy was evident. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) showed nondetectable rod and cone responses.
Symptom Onset: 10 years old
Symptom Duration: 14 years
Progression: Gradual progressive visual loss (slowly progressive)
Characteristics: Progressive rod and cone photoreceptor dysfunction and death with nyctalopia, progressive peripheral visual field loss, midperipheral retinal atrophy with pigment clumping ("bone spicules") and vascular attenuation; often preserved central vision until late stages; may include posterior subcapsular cataract and cystoid macular edema.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: Progressive night vision difficulties (nyctalopia), progressive loss of peripheral vision, clumsiness/bumps into objects, difficulty driving at night
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant—difficulty with night driving and outdoor activities after dusk, frequent bumping into objects, reduced safety at night; central vision preserved for daytime tasks.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Recent Travel: No recent travel reported
Risk Factors: Genetic inheritance (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked), positive family history (though ~50% sporadic), consanguinity (increases risk), over 150 causative gene mutations (genetic heterogeneity), certain genotypes (e.g., ABCA4) influencing progression; age (symptom onset typically 2nd–5th decades).

Severity: moderately advanced
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: cystoid macular edema; posterior subcapsular (stellate) cataract; optic nerve atrophy; vitreous syneresis and mild vitritis; weakened zonular lens support leading to challenging cataract surgery and posterior capsule fibrosis; progressive peripheral and central vision loss up to total visual loss in minority of patients


Plan
All Medications: vitamin A palmitate (15,000 IU daily); vitamin E; lutein; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); acetazolamide; dorzolamide
Follow-Up Instructions: If cataract or CME develops, consider treatment; periodic yearly liver function tests may be helpful for patients on vitamin A therapy; provide counseling regarding visual prognosis and genetic counseling/testing as appropriate; recommend sunglasses to reduce UV exposure and low-vision aids as needed; regular ophthalmic follow-up (including OCT and visual field/ERG monitoring) as clinically indicated.
Patient Education: - RP is an inherited retinal degenerative disease causing progressive night vision loss and peripheral visual field loss, with central vision usually preserved until late stages. - Genetic testing is available and can clarify inheritance, rule out syndromic forms, and help determine eligibility for clinical trials. - Sunglasses to reduce UV exposure are recommended. - If cystoid macular edema (CME) or posterior subcapsular cataract develop, treatments are available (oral acetazolamide often more effective for CME than topical dorzolamide; cataract surgery may be considered but can be more complex). - Some supplements (vitamin A palmitate, lutein, DHA) have shown possible benefit in select cases, but benefits vary by genotype and vitamin A may be harmful for certain mutations; discuss risks and genetic status before starting. - Low-vision aids and mobility training can help maintain independence; retinal implants exist for very advanced disease (light perception or worse) but provide only rudimentary vision. - Counseling about prognosis and family risk is recommended; consider referral to genetic counseling.
Referrals: Low-vision rehabilitation services and orientation/mobility training; genetic counseling and genetic testing referral; retinal specialist/clinical trials center for potential enrollment.

=====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: constant pain in the right eye for 3 weeks, blurred vision, redness, and tearing for 1 week, and headache and neck stiffness for 1 month
DURATION: 3 weeks
LATERALITY: Unilateral (initially right eye, later became bilateral)
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have constant pain in my right eye for 3 weeks, blurred vision, redness, and tearing for 1 week, and I've had a headache and neck stiffness for 1 month."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 24-year-old Hispanic woman with 3 weeks of constant right eye pain, 1 week of redness, tearing and blurred vision in the right eye, and a 1-month history of headache and neck stiffness; recent 2-day flu-like prodrome; no history of trauma.
History Narrative: A 24-year-old Hispanic woman complained of constant pain in the right eye for 3 weeks, blurred vision, redness, and tearing for 1 week, and a 1-month history of headache and neck stiffness.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 24-year-old Hispanic woman with a prodrome of headache, neck stiffness and flu-like symptoms, CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis (initially asymmetric), vitritis, diffuse low-reflectivity choroidal thickening on B-scan, bilateral serous retinal detachments, optic disc edema, and multiple pinpoint RPE hyperfluorescent lesions on fluorescein angiography. Presentation, demographics, neurologic signs, CSF findings, imaging and clinical course are most consistent with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome.
Primary Diagnosis: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome
Differential Diagnosis: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome; Sympathetic ophthalmia; Sarcoidosis; Infectious choroiditis (e.g., tuberculosis, syphilis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: posterior synechiae, angle-closure glaucoma, cataract formation, choroidal neovascularization


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (topical), cycloplegics, oral corticosteroids (prednisone 80–200 mg/day), ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, intravenous steroids (for severe cases), cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, azathioprine
All Procedures: Topical prednisolone acetate 1% instillation Cycloplegic agent administration B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye Computed tomography (CT) of the brain Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis Fluorescein angiography Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (used/recommended) Systemic corticosteroid therapy (oral prednisone 80–200 mg/day) H2-blocker (ranitidine 150 mg twice daily) for gastric protection Intravenous corticosteroids (considered for severe cases) Systemic immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, azathioprine)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow closely with frequent visits initially to adjust systemic corticosteroids until inflammation and exudative detachment improve; once controlled, gradually taper steroids over 4–6 months (up to 6 months) with less frequent exams. If inadequate control, intolerable steroid side effects, or relapse on high-dose steroids, add systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Monitor regularly for cataract, choroidal neovascularization, posterior synechiae, and angle‑closure glaucoma. Use gastric prophylaxis (e.g., H2‑blocker) while on high‑dose steroids.
Patient Education: Initiate high‑dose systemic corticosteroids promptly to reduce inflammation and preserve vision; continue topical steroid drops and a cycloplegic for anterior inflammation. Expect frequent follow-up visits early to monitor response and adjust therapy. Take gastric protection (e.g., ranitidine or other H2 blocker/proton‑pump inhibitor) while on high‑dose steroids. Report new symptoms (worsening vision, increased pain, new skin/hair changes, hearing loss, severe GI symptoms) immediately. Do not stop steroids abruptly; steroid taper will be slow (over months) to reduce recurrence risk. If side effects or inadequate control occur, additional immunosuppressive medications may be needed — discuss risks and monitoring with your physician. Consider baseline and periodic eye exams for cataract, glaucoma, and choroidal neovascularization, and seek prompt care for any visual changes.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 46-year-old woman with AIDS (CD4 64) presenting with 2-week history of bilateral floaters and decreased vision. Exam: BCVA 20/30 OD, 20/40 OS; IOP 10 mm Hg OU; mild vitritis; fundus shows fulminant hemorrhagic, wedge-shaped retinitis extending from superior optic nerve along superotemporal arcade OD and peripheral retinitis temporally OS. Clinical presentation and immunosuppressed status most consistent with CMV retinitis, OU. Plan: initiate induction antiviral therapy (systemic ganciclovir or foscarnet ± intravitreal injections if macular threat or progression), consider cidofovir or ganciclovir implant if systemic therapy contraindicated, monitor closely for progression and retinal detachment with frequent funduscopic exams and photographic documentation; coordinate HAART management.
Primary Diagnosis: CMV retinitis, OU, in a patient with AIDS
Secondary Diagnoses: AIDS (HIV infection), CMV infection
Differential Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis; Acute retinal necrosis (herpetic retinitis); Ocular toxoplasmosis; Syphilitic retinitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OU
Complications: Retinal detachment; recurrent/ progressive visual loss; cataract formation; long-term visual impairment; systemic CMV infection (if untreated); drug toxicities (myelotoxicity from ganciclovir, renal toxicity from foscarnet)


Plan
All Medications: ganciclovir (intravenous induction 5 mg/kg once daily; intravitreal 2000 μg; intraocular implant), foscarnet (intravenous induction 60 mg/kg three times daily; intravitreal 1.2 mg), cidofovir (intravenous 5 mg/kg weekly induction then every 2 weeks maintenance), highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
All Procedures: Indirect ophthalmoscopy; Anterior chamber paracentesis for PCR; Intravitreal ganciclovir injection; Intravitreal foscarnet injection; Systemic intravenous ganciclovir; Systemic intravenous foscarnet; Intravenous cidofovir; Ganciclovir intravitreal implant insertion; Pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade; Laser demarcation (prophylactic/limited)
Follow-Up Instructions: Close follow-up with photographic documentation; ophthalmoscopic screening every 3–6 months in HIV-positive patients with CD4 <100.
Patient Education: CMV retinitis is an opportunistic eye infection seen in people with AIDS and low CD4 counts; it can cause floaters, blurred vision, and progressive vision loss if untreated. Prompt ophthalmic evaluation (including dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy) is essential. Treatment options include systemic antiviral therapy (ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir), intravitreal antiviral injections or a ganciclovir implant when systemic therapy is contraindicated or disease threatens the macula; surgery (pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil) may be required for retinal detachment. Continue and optimize HAART to help immune recovery and reduce recurrence risk. Monitor vision and have regular retinal exams (every 3–6 months if CD4 <100) with photographic documentation; report any new floaters, flashes, or vision changes immediately. Be aware of medication side effects (ganciclovir: bone marrow suppression; foscarnet: renal toxicity) and ensure appropriate lab monitoring.
Referrals: Retina specialist / vitreoretinal surgeon (ophthalmology)
Emergency Instructions: Return to clinic urgently for any new floaters, flashes, sudden decrease in vision, new visual field loss, severe eye pain, or redness; seek immediate emergency care if signs of retinal detachment (shadow/curtain over vision) occur.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Multiple retinal angiomas OS consistent with von Hippel–Lindau disease.
Primary Diagnosis: Multiple retinal angiomas OS
Secondary Diagnoses: von Hippel–Lindau disease
Differential Diagnosis: Cavernous hemangioma; Racemose hemangioma (arteriovenous malformation); Retinal macroaneurysm; Vasoproliferative tumor
Severity: Mild
Laterality: OS
Complications: - Subretinal fluid and exudation leading to exudative retinal detachment and macular involvement (vision loss) - Vitreoretinal fibrosis with epiretinal membrane formation causing tractional or combined tractional–rhegmatogenous retinal detachment - Hemorrhage during surgical intervention and recurrence after treatment - Paradoxical increase in subretinal fluid, exudate, and vitreoretinal traction after treatment


Plan
All Procedures: indirect ophthalmoscopy slit‑lamp biomicroscopy fluorescein angiography fluorescein angioscopy B‑scan ultrasonography A‑scan ultrasonography computed tomography (CT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) laser photocoagulation cryotherapy (double or triple freeze‑thaw) plaque radiotherapy external beam radiotherapy pars plana vitrectomy intravitreal antiangiogenic injection systemic antiangiogenic therapy transpupillary thermotherapy 24‑hour urine collection for pheochromocytoma
Follow-Up Instructions: Annual to biannual ophthalmic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy for affected individuals and first‑degree relatives; periodic systemic screening including CNS and thoracic/abdominal imaging and 24‑hour urine collection for pheochromocytoma.
Patient Education: Because your retinal lesions are characteristic of retinal angiomas associated with von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease, you should understand the following key points: - Retinal angiomas are benign vascular tumors of the retina that can cause vision loss if they leak fluid, produce exudate, or cause tractional retinal detachment. Early lesions may be asymptomatic. - Familial association: VHL is an inherited (autosomal dominant) condition; multiple family members may be affected. Genetic testing and counseling are recommended for you and at-risk first-degree relatives. - Importance of regular eye exams: Periodic dilated retinal examinations (typically annually to every 6–12 months, or more often if lesions are active) with indirect ophthalmoscopy and imaging as needed are essential to monitor for new or changing angiomas and to detect complications early. - Systemic screening: VHL can affect the brain, spine, kidneys, pancreas, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs. You need coordinated systemic screening (neuroimaging, abdominal imaging such as CT or MRI, and biochemical testing including 24‑hour urine or plasma metanephrines for pheochromocytoma) under guidance of a multidisciplinary team. - Treatment options and indications: Not all angiomas require immediate treatment. Lesions causing vision threat (leakage, exudation, or traction) are treated with focal therapies such as laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy; larger or complicated lesions may need radiotherapy, intravitreal therapy, or surgery. Treatment response can take months and multiple sessions; rare paradoxical worsening can occur. - Eye-related symptoms to report promptly: new floaters, flashes, sudden decrease in vision, new visual field loss, or severe eye pain—these may indicate progression or complications and warrant urgent ophthalmic evaluation. - Family members: First-degree relatives should undergo ophthalmic screening and consider genetic testing; early detection improves outcomes. - Follow-up and coordination: You will need long-term follow-up with an ophthalmologist experienced in retinal tumors and referral to genetics and appropriate medical/surgical specialists for systemic surveillance and management. If you would like, I can provide a concise checklist for first steps (genetic referral, baseline neuro/abdominal imaging, 24‑hour urine/plasma metanephrines, and recommended ophthalmic follow-up interval).
Referrals: Ophthalmology (retina specialist) and multidisciplinary referral for systemic von Hippel–Lindau evaluation including neurology/neurosurgery for CNS imaging, medical oncology/urology and/or nephrology for abdominal imaging (renal), endocrinology for pheochromocytoma screening, and genetic counseling/testing

CASE 50 — Dislocated Posterior Chamber Intraocular Lens
=======================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after cataract surgery
DURATION: 6 years
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sudden decreased vision in the left eye beginning 2 days after an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior capsular rupture and PCIOL placed in the ciliary sulcus; vision 20/30 with aphakic correction, 2+ superior microbullous corneal edema, moderate anterior chamber cells, vitreous incarceration in the wound, and a freely mobile PCIOL dislocated into the inferior vitreous cavity.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman presented with a sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) insertion. During the procedure, a central posterior capsular rupture was noted, but the IOL was placed anterior to the remaining anterior capsule into the ciliary sulcus. Her vision was 20/30 in the left eye with an aphakic correction. Slit-lamp examination showed a 2+ microbullous corneal edema superiorly and moderate cells in the anterior chamber. The pupil was round, but there was vitreous incarceration in the wound. The pupillary space was clear. Residual capsule was not noted. Funduscopic examination disclosed a freely mobile PCIOL within the vitreous cavity inferiorly. The retina was attached.
Symptom Onset: 2 days after surgery
Symptom Duration: 2 days
Progression: Resolved
Characteristics: Dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) in the vitreous cavity after posterior capsular rupture with vitreous incarceration, mobile IOL, no retinal detachment, causing decreased vision and anterior chamber inflammation (cells), corneal edema; managed with pars plana vitrectomy and scleral fixation (transscleral 9-0 polypropylene sutures under scleral flaps) leading to IOL repositioned in ciliary sulcus and excellent long-term centration and visual recovery.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL), left eye (OS), secondary to posterior capsular rupture during extracapsular cataract extraction with vitreous incarceration in the wound and a freely mobile PCIOL in the inferior vitreous cavity. Associated findings: 2+ superior microbullous corneal edema and moderate anterior chamber cells; pupillary space clear; residual capsule not noted; retina attached. Visual acuity initially 20/30 aphakic correction preoperatively, 20/60 at 1 month postoperatively, improving to 20/20 by 6 months and maintained for 6 years. Recommended and performed surgical repositioning of the dislocated PCIOL with pars plana vitrectomy and transscleral scleral-suture fixation of the haptics under partial-thickness scleral flaps. Postoperative course uncomplicated with well-centered, stable IOL and no signs of retinal detachment, cystoid macular edema, or suture-related complications. Prognosis excellent with restoration of 20/20 vision.
Primary Diagnosis: Dislocated posterior chamber IOL, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens; Zonular dehiscence with IOL subluxation (e.g., pseudoexfoliation-related); Capsular rupture with IOL malposition into the vitreous; Traumatic IOL dislocation
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: cystoid macular edema; elevated intraocular pressure; retinal detachment (RD); suture knot erosion; endophthalmitis; hemorrhage; IOL torsion or malposition; recurrent dislocation due to suture breakage; endothelial trauma; postsurgical astigmatism


Plan
All Procedures: Pars plana vitrectomy; scleral fixation of posterior chamber IOL with transscleral 9–0 polypropylene sutures through partial-thickness scleral flaps (IOL repositioning into the ciliary sulcus)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up with ophthalmology postoperatively for wound check and IOP/inflammation monitoring within 1–2 weeks, then periodic exams to assess IOL position, retina (peripheral exam for tears/detachment), and visual acuity; monitor for cystoid macular edema and elevated IOP, with long-term routine follow-up as needed.
Patient Education: Explain the diagnosis of a dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL), why it likely occurred (posterior capsular rupture and limited capsular support), and the treatment options: observation with medical management (topical anti‑inflammatories, ocular hypotensives, and miotics for symptomatic decentration) versus surgical repair (pars plana vitrectomy with scleral fixation/repositioning of the IOL or IOL exchange/removal). Discuss expected timing (usually within 2 weeks for acute symptomatic dislocation), risks and benefits of surgery (improved vision common — many achieve 20/40 or better; risks include cystoid macular edema, elevated IOP, retinal detachment, infection, suture-related complications), and the typical recovery course and follow‑up (postop checks to monitor vision, IOP, retina; possible need for additional treatment). Advise to report sudden vision loss, new floaters, flashes, pain, or redness promptly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema of the right eye following complicated phacoemulsification with posterior capsular rupture and sulcus IOL placement. Eight weeks postoperatively the patient reports decreased vision after initial good acuity; exam shows BCVA 20/80 OD, posterior vitreous detachment, macular thickening with visible cystic spaces on exam and OCT (cysts in inner nuclear layer), and petaloid perifoveal leakage on fluorescein angiography consistent with CME. No other systemic or ocular contributory history (no diabetes or hypertension). No peripheral retinal breaks; IOL well centered; anterior chamber quiet. Management considerations include topical NSAID and steroid therapy initially, with periocular or intravitreal steroids or surgical intervention (pars plana vitrectomy or removal of incarcerated vitreous) if medical therapy fails or if anterior segment vitreous incarceration/traction is identified. Follow-up in 4–6 weeks to assess response.
Primary Diagnosis: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema, OD
Secondary Diagnoses: Posterior vitreous detachment; Central posterior capsular rupture during cataract surgery; Vitreous loss/prolapse into anterior chamber at time of surgery; Pseudophakia (sulcus-fixed IOL)
Differential Diagnosis: Pseudophakic (Irvine–Gass) cystoid macular edema; Diabetic macular edema; Uveitic (inflammatory) cystoid macular edema
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: Posterior vitreous detachment; cystoid macular edema (postoperative/pseudophakic CME); decreased visual acuity (20/80 OD)


Plan
All Medications: flurbiprofen (topical), suprofen (topical), ketorolac 0.5% eye drops (topical), prednisolone 1% eye drops, periocular corticosteroid injection (e.g., triamcinolone), intravitreal corticosteroid injection (e.g., triamcinolone), intravitreal ranibizumab, intravitreal bevacizumab, intravitreal aflibercept
All Procedures: phacoemulsification with insertion of an acrylic intraocular lens into the ciliary sulcus (performed prior to presentation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe within 4 to 6 weeks after initiating medical treatment; follow carefully even after improvement due to risk of recurrence.
Patient Education: This is cystoid macular edema (CME), a common cause of decreased vision after cataract surgery caused by fluid collecting in the central retina. It often improves with time and with treatment. Initial management is topical anti‑inflammatory eye drops (a steroid and/or an NSAID) and close follow‑up in 4–6 weeks to monitor vision and retinal swelling with OCT. If there is no improvement or if vitreous or retained lens material is suspected, injections (peri‑ or intravitreal steroids) or surgical treatment (vitrectomy or removal of entrapped vitreous/lens fragments) may be recommended. Notify your doctor promptly for worsening vision, new floaters, pain, or eye redness. Maintain scheduled appointments and use drops exactly as prescribed; report any steroid‑related side effects (eye pressure changes, pain).


CASE 52 — Endophthalmitis
=========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 10/10 eye pain and decreased vision in the left eye upon awakening
DURATION: 5 days
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I woke up with 10/10 eye pain and decreased vision in my left eye."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 59-year-old woman awoke 5 days after an uneventful combined cataract and LASIK procedure with severe left eye pain (10/10) and decreased vision; postoperative course had been otherwise standard until this acute onset. On presentation her vision was hand motion with pronounced conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, anterior chamber reaction with hypopyon, and fibrin on the intraocular lens; B‑scan showed moderately dense membranous vitreous opacities.
History Narrative: This 59-year-old woman awoke with 10/10 eye pain and decreased vision in her left eye.

All Medications: vancomycin; ceftazidime; dexamethasone; topical fortified vancomycin; topical fortified ceftazidime; prednisolone; cyclopentolate; amikacin; fourth-generation fluoroquinolones (mentioned); intracameral cefuroxime; triamcinolone; systemic antibiotics (amikacin and ceftazidime referenced); intravitreal antifungals/antibiotics (general)
All Procedures: Combined cataract and LASIK procedure; vitreous tap and intravitreal injection (vancomycin, ceftazidime, dexamethasone); B-scan ultrasonography; topical fortified antibiotic and steroid therapy; laser capsulotomy
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow clinically with gradual taper of topical fortified vancomycin and ceftazidime, prednisolone, and cyclopentolate; monitor visual acuity, anterior chamber inflammation, and vitreous status; perform repeat intravitreal antibiotics or pars plana vitrectomy if clinical worsening or poor response; obtain and review culture results to guide therapy; arrange close follow‑up within 24–48 hours initially and then frequently until resolution; consider late laser capsulotomy once inflammation resolved.
Patient Education: You have an infection inside your eye (endophthalmitis) that can threaten vision. It most commonly happens after eye surgery or injections and causes pain, redness, decreased vision, and sometimes pus in the eye. Treatment is urgent: a sample of the vitreous is taken and powerful antibiotics are injected directly into the eye; sometimes surgery (vitrectomy) is needed, especially if vision is very poor. You may also receive intensive antibiotic and steroid eye drops and close follow-up. Most patients treated promptly recover good vision, but outcomes depend on how quickly treatment starts and the germ involved. Preventive measures for future procedures include use of povidone–iodine and sterile technique. If you notice new pain, increasing redness, or sudden vision loss after an eye procedure, seek immediate care.
Referrals: Infectious disease consult (if endogenous or systemic involvement)

Primary Diagnosis: Appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhage, left eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Cardiac bypass surgery (history), systemic hypertension, myopia (−9.00 D), primary open‑angle glaucoma, aphakia
Differential Diagnosis: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; Exudative (serous) retinal detachment; Serous choroidal effusion; Suprachoroidal hemorrhage
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhage with retinal apposition leading to severe vision loss (final VA 20/400), elevated intraocular pressure, shallow anterior chamber, pain, aphakia, and need for pars plana vitrectomy with drainage (surgical complication of recent cataract surgery)


Plan
All Medications: timolol 0.5% OU twice daily; dorzolamide 2% OU three times daily; prednisolone acetate 1% OS four times per day; balanced salt solution (used intraoperatively)
All Procedures: Pars plana vitrectomy; drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhage; fluid–gas exchange; serial echography (ultrasonography); medical management of elevated intraocular pressure (topical/systemic IOP-lowering medications)
Patient Education: Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is bleeding between the choroid and sclera that can cause sudden severe eye pain, high eye pressure, and sudden vision loss. It most often occurs during or after eye surgery or trauma, and risk factors include older age, high blood pressure, glaucoma, nearsightedness, blood thinners, and recent intraocular surgery. Initial care may include pain control and medications to lower eye pressure; imaging (ultrasound) is used to confirm the diagnosis and follow the clot as it liquefies. Small or early clotted hemorrhages are often observed because surgery is more effective after the blood liquefies (commonly 7–14 days). If the hemorrhage is appositional (“kissing” choroidals), causes uncontrolled high pressure, severe pain, or threatens the retina, surgical drainage with vitrectomy may be recommended. Surgery aims to drain liquefied blood, relieve pressure, and repair associated retinal problems. Possible outcomes: vision may recover partially but can remain poor, especially if there is retinal detachment, extensive hemorrhage, or delayed treatment. Follow-up includes serial ultrasounds, intraocular pressure checks, and monitoring for retinal complications. Preventive measures for future surgery include optimizing blood pressure and eye pressure, minimizing intraoperative hypotony, and securing wounds promptly. Seek urgent care for sudden severe eye pain, marked vision loss, or a very hard eye after eye surgery or trauma.


CASE 54 — Ruptured Globe
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor vision in the left eye after a fall (noted the morning after)
LATERALITY: OS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 80-year-old woman who fell at her nursing home the prior day onto furniture with periocular ecchymoses; initially no pain or visual loss but on awakening the next morning noted poor vision. Had prior cataract surgery (extracapsular nuclear expression) 3 years earlier with preinjury vision 20/30 limited by atrophic macular degeneration. Presented the morning after the fall with hand‑motion vision, IOP 10 mm Hg, temporal and superior conjunctival chemosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage, and scleral dehiscence at the prior cataract wound with the posterior chamber IOL displaced into the subconjunctival space; view posteriorly limited by dense vitreous hemorrhage.
History Narrative: An 80-year-old woman presented the morning after falling at her nursing home. The exact history was unclear, but periocular ecchymoses suggested direct ocular trauma on a piece of furniture. Initially she had not noticed pain or visual loss, but upon waking the next morning she realized poor vision and sought consultation. She had undergone cataract surgery with a nuclear expression extracapsular technique 3 years previously; preinjury vision was 20/30 limited by atrophic macular degeneration changes. On presentation vision was hand motions and intraocular pressure 10 mm Hg. The cornea appeared relatively clear with a formed anterior chamber. There was conjunctival chemosis temporally and superiorly; no conjunctival laceration was seen, but a scleral dehiscence was evident at the previous cataract wound and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in the subconjunctival space. The posterior view was limited by dense vitreous hemorrhage. The pupil was not peaked and there was no vitreous anterior to the iris.
Symptom Onset: 1 day (the morning after the fall)
Symptom Duration: 1 day
Progression: Improved — retina attached posteriorly with minimal epiretinal membrane; vision improved from hand motions to 20/100 (aphakic) three months postoperatively.
Characteristics: Ruptured globe with scleral dehiscence at prior cataract wound (superotemporal), subconjunctival IOL, vitreous hemorrhage, no APD, formed anterior chamber, aphakia, focal subretinal hemorrhage (superotemporal midperiphery), no retinal detachment.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: Periocular ecchymoses, poor vision (progression to hand motions), subconjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival chemosis, dense vitreous hemorrhage, focal subretinal hemorrhage, no pain initially, no afferent pupillary defect
Prior Treatments: Cataract surgery with a nuclear expression extracapsular technique (3 years prior)
Impact on Daily Activities: Likely significant impairment of daily activities in the injured eye, with reduced vision to hand motions initially and final acuity 20/100 (aphakic), necessitating rehabilitation and possible vocational changes.
Recent Travel: No recent travel
Risk Factors: Previous cataract surgery (prior incision as site of dehiscence), advanced age (elderly), history of blunt trauma/fall, periocular ecchymosis, previous extracapsular cataract incision (thinned sclera at prior wound)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 80-year-old woman with left ruptured globe through previous cataract incision with subconjunctival IOL and dense vitreous hemorrhage. Presented with HM vision, IOP 10 mmHg, formed anterior chamber, temporal/superior conjunctival chemosis and scleral dehiscence with vitreous prolapse to the wound; no afferent pupillary defect and no anterior vitreous in front of iris. Underwent same-day vitrectomy, removal of intraocular lens, and placement of an encircling scleral buckle. Intraoperatively there was vitreous incarcerated at the wound, a sheet of vitreous streaming to the dehiscence, no retinal detachment but a focal superotemporal midperipheral subretinal hemorrhage. Postoperatively retina attached with minimal epiretinal membrane and organized subretinal hemorrhage at the buckle base; final vision 20/100 aphakic. Overall an open-globe rupture primarily repaired with secondary posterior segment intervention resulting in anatomic reattachment and moderate visual recovery.
Primary Diagnosis: Ruptured globe, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Occult globe rupture (anterior wound dehiscence at prior cataract incision); Traumatic lens/IOL extrusion with subconjunctival implant; Vitreous hemorrhage from intraocular trauma; Traumatic retinal detachment
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS
Complications: subconjunctival hemorrhage; vitreous hemorrhage; scleral wound dehiscence with extrusion of intraocular lens; vitreous incarceration/streaming to wound; subretinal hemorrhage; epiretinal membrane; aphakia; potential retinal traction from organized subretinal hemorrhage (treated with scleral buckle)


Plan
All Procedures: vitrectomy; placement of an encircling scleral band (scleral buckle); removal of the intraocular lens (IOL)
Follow-Up Instructions: As long as anatomic and visual stabilization is observed, lengthen follow-up intervals; cicatricial response is usually complete by 6 weeks post‑surgery. Monitor weekly to every 10 days initially; consider secondary vitreoretinal repair within 1–2 weeks if light perception is present. At ~3 months, consider additional surgery (epiretinal membrane removal or secondary IOL) and visual rehabilitation (rigid contact lens). Recommend shatter‑proof safety glasses and coordinate vocational rehabilitation as needed.
Patient Education: - Place a protective eye shield over the injured eye to prevent further damage or pressure. - Keep the head elevated and avoid activities that increase eye pressure (heavy lifting, straining, bending). - Take prescribed broad‑spectrum intravenous/oral antibiotics as directed to reduce risk of endophthalmitis. - Ensure tetanus immunization is up to date; receive tetanus shot if not within 5 years. - Wear shatter‑proof safety glasses on the fellow eye and for future protection. - Attend scheduled follow‑up visits closely (first week–10 days, then as advised) and report any sudden pain, vision loss, increased redness, or drainage immediately. - Understand that secondary vitreoretinal surgery may be needed in 1–2 weeks and additional procedures (IOL implantation, membrane removal) may be considered around 3 months for visual rehabilitation. - Consider vocational rehabilitation and social work support if unilateral vision loss limits daily activities or work.
Work Restrictions: Avoid heavy lifting, straining, bending, and activities with risk of ocular impact; wear protective/shatter-proof eyewear; restrict work duties to light, non-contact tasks until cleared by ophthalmology (typically several weeks).
Emergency Instructions: Place a protective shield over the eye to protect it from further trauma and pressure; administer parenteral broad‑spectrum antibiotics; give tetanus booster if not received within 5 years; obtain urgent ophthalmic surgical evaluation for primary globe closure (keep eye shielded and avoid pressure/manipulation).


CASE 55 — Intraocular Foreign Body
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision in the left eye after metal-on-metal impact while working (suspected intraocular foreign body)
DURATION: 25 years
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "something like a piece of dust going onto the eye"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 32-year-old man was working aboard a docked marine biology research ship repairing a metal banister; while striking the metal rail with a metal hammer he felt a minor pain in his left eye and over the next 2 hours noticed a subtle but definite decrease in vision, presenting with VA 20/30.
History Narrative: A 32-year-old man was working aboard a docked marine biology research ship repairing a metal banister. While striking the metal rail with a metal hammer, he experienced a minor pain in his left eye. Over the ensuing 2 hours, he noticed a subtle but definite decrease in vision. On presentation, his visual acuity was 20/30. Slit-lamp examination showed a deep anterior chamber with minimal cell and flare. There was a defect in the temporal iris approximately 1mm from the limbus. Corresponding to this site was a slitlike corneal defect that was not leaking aqueous fluid by Seidel testing. Posterior to the iris, there was a sectoral, white opacity in the peripheral lens. Examination of the posterior pole disclosed a small intraocular foreign body embedded in the retinal midperiphery with a collar of retinal edema surrounding it but no hemorrhage.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body (left eye) with entry through temporal peripheral cornea, iris and lens causing sectoral peripheral lens opacity and a small midperipheral retinal impact with surrounding retinal edema. Clinical course: prompt pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy, posterior chamber IOL implantation, magnetic extraction of IOFB, endolaser surrounding impact site, and low encircling scleral buckle placed. Intraoperative creation of posterior vitreous detachment; mild retinal hemorrhage at removal site controlled. Postoperative course: retina attached with restoration and maintenance of 20/20 vision over 25 years. Recommendations: initial broad-spectrum systemic (and when indicated intravitreal) antibiotics, topical steroids/antibiotics/cycloplegic postoperatively, and close early follow-up to monitor for endophthalmitis, recurrent retinal detachment, and epiretinal membrane formation.
Primary Diagnosis: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Retained intraocular foreign body (metallic/magnetic); Traumatic globe rupture with intraocular penetration; Intraocular glass foreign body; Endophthalmitis from penetrating injury

Complications: retinal detachment; endophthalmitis; retinal hemorrhage (at site of removal); retinal edema/collarette; epiretinal membrane formation; siderosis (from metallic IOFB)


Plan
All Medications: prophylactic antibiotics (broad-spectrum; systemic and/or intravitreal as indicated), systemic antibiotics (IV), topical corticosteroids, topical antibiotics, cycloplegic agents
All Procedures: vitrectomy; lensectomy; intraocular lens implantation; magnetic extraction of intraocular foreign body; low encircling scleral buckle placement; laser photocoagulation (endolaser) surrounding retinal defect; induction of posterior vitreous detachment with vitrectomy instrument; closure/repair of corneal/entry wounds as needed
Follow-Up Instructions: Observed at approximately 1–2 week intervals during the first month postoperatively, then less frequently thereafter; monitor for signs of endophthalmitis, recurrent retinal detachment, and epiretinal membrane formation; continue IV antibiotics and topical corticosteroids/antibiotics/cycloplegic as indicated and discontinue systemic antibiotics if clinically stable after 24–48 hours.
Patient Education: Avoid industrial eye hazards; wear protective metal-rated safety eyewear during metalworking. Seek urgent evaluation after any high-velocity ocular injury, even if symptoms are mild. Do not undergo MRI if an intraocular metallic foreign body is suspected. Prompt surgical repair and antibiotic treatment are important to reduce risk of infection and preserve vision. Follow postoperative instructions, attend scheduled follow-ups to monitor for infection or retinal complications, and report any increasing pain, redness, vision loss, or floaters immediately.
Emergency Instructions: Promptly evaluate any suspected intraocular foreign body; avoid MRI until nonmagnetic status confirmed; obtain plain X-rays and/or CT (and B-scan if globe integrity permits) to localize; start broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics (consider intravitreal antibiotics if high risk) and arrange urgent surgical removal (preferably within 6–12 hours) with vitrectomy/lensectomy and appropriate retinal repair; avoid globe compression and protect eye with shield.


CASE 56 — Optic Neuritis
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Acute onset blurred vision in the right eye with retro-orbital pain made worse by eye movement, noted 12 days ago

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Typical optic neuritis (papillitis) of the right eye — acute, unilateral optic neuropathy with retro-orbital pain worsened by eye movement, right relative afferent pupillary defect, decreased visual acuity to 20/80, reduced color vision (3/10 Ishihara), superior arcuate visual field defect, and a mildly hyperemic swollen right optic disc; most consistent with demyelinating/idiopathic optic neuritis; MRI recommended to evaluate for demyelinating lesions and to assess future MS risk; treat with IV methylprednisolone per ONTT protocol (consider oral taper) unless atypical features or NMO/MOG suspected, in which case pursue serologic testing (AQP4-IgG, MOG) and further inflammatory/infectious workup.
Primary Diagnosis: Typical optic neuritis (papillitis)
Differential Diagnosis: Demyelinating optic neuritis (typically MS-related); Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG); Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-associated optic neuritis; Ischemic optic neuropathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Development of multiple sclerosis (increased risk of clinically definite MS, especially with demyelinating lesions on MRI) - Potential progression to neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMO/NMOSD) with worse visual prognosis - Persistent visual loss (rare; some patients remain 20/200 or worse) - Recurrent optic neuritis


Plan
All Medications: methylprednisolone sodium succinate (IV methylprednisolone), oral prednisone
All Procedures: MRI of the brain (with orbital imaging for optic nerve) and intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (high-dose IV steroids)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up with neuro-ophthalmology or ophthalmology within 1–2 weeks for reassessment of vision, color vision, visual fields, and pupillary exam; obtain brain and orbit MRI with contrast (to evaluate for demyelinating lesions and optic nerve enhancement) if not already done; consider starting IV methylprednisolone per ONTT protocol if rapid visual recovery desired or MRI abnormal/monocular patient (250 mg IV q6h ×3 days followed by oral steroid taper) or high‑dose oral steroid alternative; if atypical features or poor recovery, order serum AQP4-IgG (NMO) and consider MOG antibody testing and additional infectious/inflammatory workup; arrange neurology referral for MS risk counseling if MRI shows demyelinating lesions.
Patient Education: You have optic neuritis, an inflammation of the optic nerve that commonly causes sudden vision loss, eye pain (especially with eye movement), and decreased color vision. For most typical cases like yours, vision often begins to improve within days to weeks and may continue to recover for months. We will obtain an MRI of the brain to look for signs of demyelinating disease (which affects future risk of multiple sclerosis) and to rule out other causes. Treatment options include high‑dose intravenous steroids to speed recovery and, in certain situations, reduce short‑term risk of MS; oral prednisone at standard doses should be avoided alone. If testing suggests neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or other atypical causes, additional blood tests (AQP4 and sometimes MOG antibodies) and different immunosuppressive treatments may be needed. Report any worsening vision, new neurologic symptoms, severe steroid side effects, or inability to perform daily activities. Follow-up appointments and repeat vision/field testing will monitor recovery; most patients have substantial improvement by 1 month, and continued gradual gains up to a year.
Referrals: Neuro-ophthalmology and MRI brain (with orbit) — consider neurology referral for MS/NMOSD workup (AQP4/MOG antibody testing)
Work Restrictions: No work restrictions.

Assessment Narrative: 22-year-old woman with 3-week history of progressive blurred vision in the right eye following a nonspecific flulike illness, minimal periorbital pain, and household exposure to cats. Exam: OD VA 20/60, OS 20/15; dyschromatopsia OD (4/10 plates); cecocentral scotoma OD; right RAPD; 1+ vitreous cells OD; marked right optic disc edema with peripapillary and macular exudates forming a macular star; left fundus normal. Laboratory testing: markedly positive Bartonella henselae IgM and IgG. Impression: optic disc edema with macular star (neuroretinitis) secondary to cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae).
Primary Diagnosis: ODEMS (neuroretinitis) secondary to cat-scratch disease
Differential Diagnosis: Idiopathic (viral/immune-mediated) neuroretinitis; Bartonella (cat-scratch disease) neuroretinitis; Syphilitic or other infectious neuroretinitis (Lyme, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis); Vascular optic neuropathies (anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal vein occlusion)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy; macular retinal pigment epithelial changes; potential persistent visual disability; recurrence in same or fellow eye


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Reevaluate within 2 weeks for development of a macular star; routine ophthalmic follow-up to monitor visual recovery and resolution of disc edema; arrange appropriate infectious workup/treatment (e.g., Bartonella titers and antibiotics if positive) and tailor further follow-up based on response.
Patient Education: You have neuroretinitis (optic disc swelling with a macular star), most often caused by infections like cat‑scratch disease. It commonly improves over weeks to months and many people recover good vision, but some permanent changes can remain. Because you have cats and positive Bartonella tests, antibiotics (for cat‑scratch disease) are recommended. Follow‑up eye exams are important to monitor vision, optic disc swelling, and the macula (the macular star can appear after initial exam). Report any worsening vision, new pain, flashes, or increased floaters promptly. Most cases do not lead to multiple sclerosis. If you have systemic symptoms (fever, rash, cough) or signs of other infections, let your doctor know—additional testing (syphilis, Lyme, TB, toxoplasmosis) may be done if indicated.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 65-year-old woman with sudden painless vision loss in the left eye upon awakening 3 days ago. Exam: OD 20/20 with small cup-to-disc ratio (0.1); OS 20/200 with diffuse optic disc swelling, peripapillary hemorrhages, dense inferior altitudinal visual field defect, color dyschromatopsia OS, and left relative afferent pupillary defect. Vascular risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Presentation and findings consistent with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) of the left eye; arteritic AION (giant cell arteritis) should be considered and inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) obtained to exclude arteritic cause.
Primary Diagnosis: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, left eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus; Hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Ischemic optic neuropathy (nonarteritic vs arteritic AION); Optic neuritis; Compressive optic neuropathy; Infiltrative/inflammatory optic neuropathy
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Risk of involvement of the fellow eye (≈12% lifetime) and permanent visual loss in the affected eye (sectoral/diffuse optic atrophy leading to persistent visual field defect and decreased acuity); increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction related to shared vascular risk factors.


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Control vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), consider aspirin to reduce fellow-eye/stroke risk, monitor vision and optic disc for progression or improvement, obtain ESR and CRP to evaluate for giant cell arteritis if not already done, and arrange ophthalmology follow-up for visual acuity, visual fields, and optic nerve assessment (reevaluate within weeks and at 6 months).
Patient Education: You have nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), which causes sudden, usually painless vision loss in one eye due to reduced blood supply to the optic nerve. Common risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a small optic nerve “cup” in the other eye. There is no proven treatment that reliably restores vision, but controlling vascular risk factors (optimizing blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol; stop smoking) and avoiding low blood pressure episodes (especially at night or after surgery) are important. Your doctor may recommend blood tests (ESR and CRP) to rule out giant cell arteritis, which requires urgent treatment if positive. Aspirin is sometimes used to lower the risk in the other eye and to reduce stroke/heart attack risk; discuss risks and benefits with your physician. Expect some chance of partial spontaneous improvement over months; regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist/neuro-ophthalmologist and visual rehabilitation (low-vision services) can help maximize function. Seek urgent care if you develop severe headache, jaw pain, scalp tenderness, new systemic symptoms, or sudden vision loss in the other eye.


CASE 59 — Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy—Arteritic
======================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Severe visual loss in the left eye over hours with prior transient vision loss in that eye
DURATION: Hours
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I had severe visual loss in my left eye — over a period of hours it became markedly blurry." "Over the last 2 weeks I had two or three episodes of painless, transient visual loss lasting minutes in my left eye." "I have had diffuse, dull headaches for several months with occasional 'ice pick–like' pains affecting my left or right temples." "I have jaw claudication and polymyalgia rheumatica–like symptoms."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 68-year-old woman with sudden severe visual loss in the left eye over hours, preceded for 2 weeks by two to three episodes of painless transient visual loss in that eye lasting minutes. Over several months she had diffuse dull headaches with occasional ice‑pick temple pains, jaw claudication, and polymyalgia rheumatica–like symptoms. Denied periocular/orbital pain. Past history notable for hypertension. On exam vision 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS with color vision loss OS, left RAPD, normal motility, swollen pale left optic disc with peripapillary hemorrhages; right cup-to-disc ratio 0.5.
History Narrative: A 68-year-old woman complained of severe visual loss in the left eye that became markedly blurry over a period of hours.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 68-year-old woman with acute, severe left visual loss over hours with preceding transient monocular visual obscurations, temporal headaches, jaw claudication, and PMR-like symptoms. Examination: VA 20/20 OD, 20/400 OS, color vision 10/10 OD, 0/10 OS, left RAPD, left optic disc swollen, pallid with peripapillary hemorrhages; right cup-to-disc 0.5. ESR 70 mm/hr and CRP 20 mg/dL. Temporal artery biopsy showing transmural lymphocytic infiltration with multinucleated giant cells and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy due to giant cell arteritis. Immediate high-dose corticosteroid therapy initiated to prevent further visual loss; temporal artery biopsy obtained confirming GCA. Continued monitoring of vision, ESR/CRP and systemic steroid management with rheumatology/internist follow-up recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (arteritic AION)
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Polymyalgia rheumatica
Differential Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (giant cell arteritis); Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Central retinal artery occlusion; Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Further visual loss in the involved or fellow eye (including bilateral blindness); central retinal artery occlusion, posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, choroidal ischemia/infraction, ocular ischemic syndrome, intracranial (e.g., occipital lobe) ischemia; steroid therapy–related complications (systemic side effects)


Plan
All Medications: corticosteroids (oral prednisone 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day), intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day), methotrexate
All Procedures: temporal artery biopsy, high-dose corticosteroid therapy (oral prednisone 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day; consider IV methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day for severe cases)
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful monitoring for visual changes and constitutional symptoms; serial ESR and CRP testing; close ophthalmology follow-up to monitor fellow eye and optic nerve status; monitor for steroid adverse effects with internist/rheumatologist involvement; consider temporal artery biopsy confirmation and discuss steroid-sparing therapy (e.g., methotrexate) if long-term high-dose steroids cause side effects.
Patient Education: You have giant cell arteritis (GCA), a blood vessel inflammation that can cause sudden, severe vision loss. Because it can threaten the other eye and cause other complications, treatment must start immediately. Key points: - Start high‑dose corticosteroids right away as recommended by your doctor to reduce the risk of more vision loss; do not wait for the biopsy result. - Report any new symptoms promptly (worsening vision, new headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain when chewing, weakness, fever or weight loss). - Expect blood tests (ESR and CRP) to be followed serially to monitor inflammation, and a temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. - You may need long‑term steroid therapy with a gradual taper; steroids have side effects (high blood pressure, blood sugar elevation, osteoporosis, infection risk) — discuss prevention and monitoring with your doctor. - Follow up closely with your ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist/internist for medication management and to consider steroid‑sparing options if needed (e.g., methotrexate). - Use measures to reduce steroid side effects: bone protection (calcium/vitamin D, possibly bisphosphonates), monitor blood pressure and glucose, and report any new infections. - Seek emergency care immediately for any sudden change in vision in either eye.
Referrals: Internist and/or rheumatologist
Emergency Instructions: Start high‑dose corticosteroids immediately to prevent further visual loss; do not delay treatment for temporal artery biopsy. Seek urgent evaluation by ophthalmology and rheumatology/internist; obtain ESR and CRP and arrange temporal artery biopsy. Go to emergency department now for IV methylprednisolone if severe recent bilateral loss, monocular status, or vision worsening despite oral steroids.


CASE 60 — Progressive Optic Neuropathy—Tumor
============================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: painless progressive visual loss in her right eye
DURATION: 3 years
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "vision was no better after the surgery"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 64‑year‑old woman with a multi‑year history of painless, progressive visual loss in the right eye beginning ~3 years ago (initially mild blurring and VA 20/40 OD), with gradual worsening despite right cataract surgery one year later (vision declined to 20/60 then to 20/100), associated with decreased color vision OD, relative afferent pupillary defect, and no headache or eye pain.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman with painless progressive visual loss in her right eye over several years. Three years earlier she noticed mild blurring in the right eye with VA 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS; this was attributed to nuclear sclerotic cataract and observed. One year later vision worsened to 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, and she underwent right cataract surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens, but reported no visual improvement and continued deterioration. She denied headache or eye pain. On exam visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/20 OS. Color vision: 2/10 pseudoisochromatic plates OD, 9/10 OS. Visual field testing showed diffuse depression OD and normal field OS. Pupils 5 mm bilaterally, poorly reactive to light on the right and brisk on the left, with a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular motility normal. Hertel exophthalmometry (base 95) 22 mm OD and 19 mm OS (mild proptosis OD). Slit-lamp: posterior chamber IOL OD, mild nuclear sclerotic cataract OS. Fundus: pale, atrophic optic nerve OD; normal left optic disc.
Symptom Onset: 3 years ago

Primary Diagnosis: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) with papilledema
Differential Diagnosis: Papilledema due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri); Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; Hypertensive papillopathy; Bilateral optic neuritis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Complete blindness and permanent optic atrophy


Plan
All Medications: acetazolamide; methazolamide; furosemide; corticosteroids
All Procedures: MRI head with and without contrast; MRV; lumbar puncture (spinal tap) with opening pressure measurement and CSF studies; blood pressure measurement; acetazolamide medical therapy (1–2 g/day) [standard]; repeat lumbar punctures (as needed); ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal CSF shunting; optic nerve sheath fenestration; cerebral venous sinus stenting (controversial).
Follow-Up Instructions: Return monthly for 6–12 months for careful evaluation of formal visual fields, stereo optic-disc photos, OCT of the nerves, visual acuity, color vision, and RAPD testing; extend visit intervals if stable but continue long-term monitoring for recurrence or treatment failure.
Patient Education: Explain pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension): increased pressure around the brain causing headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and visual symptoms; discuss risk factors (especially obesity) and need for prompt monitoring to protect vision. Advise importance of weight loss as an effective treatment (dietary measures; consider bariatric surgery if morbidly obese). Review symptoms that require urgent evaluation (worsening vision, persistent or worsening headaches, new double vision, increasing transient visual obscurations). Explain diagnostic tests performed (MRI/MRV to rule out masses or venous thrombosis, lumbar puncture showing high opening pressure with normal CSF). Describe treatment options: medical therapy with acetazolamide (benefits, typical dose 1–2 g/day, and pregnancy precautions), adjunctive diuretics (e.g., furosemide), short-term corticosteroids generally avoided, and that repeated lumbar punctures are not preferred. Discuss surgical options if vision worsens or medical therapy fails: optic nerve sheath fenestration and CSF shunting (VP or LP shunt), with risks and possible need for further procedures. Emphasize need for regular ophthalmic follow-up with visual fields, optic nerve photos/OCT, visual acuity, color vision, and RAPD testing (monthly initially for 6–12 months). Encourage coordination with primary care, neurology, and obstetrics if pregnant; avoid teratogenic medications in pregnancy and discuss timing/risks of acetazolamide. Provide reassurance about potential for improvement with treatment but stress urgency of monitoring to prevent permanent vision loss.

Examination revealed visual acuity of 20/80 on the right and 20/20 on the left. He could identify 4 of 10 pseudoisochromatic plates on the right and 10 of 10 on the left. Pupils were 4 mm bilaterally and both reacted well to light and near, but there was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Visual fields revealed generalized diffuse depression on the right and a superotemporal field defect respecting the vertical meridian on the left. Motility exam was normal. Slit-lamp examination was normal. The right optic disc was diffusely pale. The left optic disc, vessels, and macula were normal.
Symptom Onset: 1.5 years
Symptom Duration: 1.5 years
Progression: Progressive over 1.5 years
Characteristics: Junctional scotoma: ipsilateral central scotoma with optic atrophy and RAPD, contralateral superotemporal field defect respecting the vertical meridian due to compressive lesion at the optic nerve–chiasm junction

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right optic neuropathy with junctional scotoma secondary to compressive lesion at the junction of the right optic nerve and optic chiasm — imaging consistent with pituitary adenoma.
Primary Diagnosis: Right optic neuropathy with junctional scotoma secondary to compressive lesion of the right optic nerve–chiasm junction (pituitary adenoma)
Differential Diagnosis: Pituitary adenoma; suprasellar meningioma; supraclinoid aneurysm; craniopharyngioma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy; progressive vision loss; relative afferent pupillary defect; persistent visual field defects (junctional scotoma); potential need for hormone replacement; possible residual visual deficits after surgery; risk of tumor recurrence requiring further surgery/chemoradiation.


Plan
All Medications: dopamine agonists (for prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors); hormone replacement therapy
All Procedures: - Visual acuity testing - Color vision testing (pseudoisochromatic plates) - Pupillary examination (including RAPD assessment) - Confrontation/automated visual field testing - Ocular motility exam - Slit-lamp examination - Fundoscopic/optic disc examination - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/sellar region - Hormone evaluation/replacement for pituitary dysfunction - Surgical decompression (transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma) - Histopathologic analysis of resected tumor - Postoperative surveillance with periodic MRI - Serial ophthalmologic follow-up with repeat visual field testing
Follow-Up Instructions: Ophthalmologic exam including visual field testing every 4 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter, with periodic MRI monitoring for tumor growth.
Patient Education: You have a compressive lesion (pituitary tumor) pressing where the right optic nerve meets the optic chiasm, which explains your progressive, painless right-sided vision loss and the small upper-temporal field defect in the left eye. Recommended steps and expectations: - Treatment: surgical decompression is usually recommended to relieve pressure; some tumors (prolactinomas) may be treated with medicines; radiation/chemotherapy only if needed after pathology. - Hormones: pituitary tumors can affect hormone production — you may need endocrine testing and possible hormone replacement. - Vision: some recovery of vision and color perception is possible after successful decompression, but long-standing optic atrophy may limit recovery. - Monitoring: regular follow-up with visual acuity, color testing, and visual fields (every ~4 months for the first year, then ~6 months) plus periodic MRI to watch for tumor recurrence or growth. - Warning signs: seek urgent care for sudden vision loss, severe new headaches, nausea/vomiting, double vision, or symptoms of hormonal imbalance (weakness, weight change, low libido). - Practical tips: protect the better-seeing eye, bring a list of current symptoms and medications to appointments, and consider low-vision aids or occupational therapy if vision remains limited. Discuss treatment options and endocrine evaluation with your neurosurgeon and endocrinologist; ask about expected visual prognosis based on duration of symptoms and imaging.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Bitemporal visual field defect consistent with chiasmal compression from a pituitary macroadenoma; recommend MRI sella with and without gadolinium and endocrinologic evaluation; likely pituitary adenoma causing progressive, painless bitemporal hemianopia with headaches and impaired driving.
Primary Diagnosis: Bitemporal visual field defect secondary to pituitary macroadenoma
Differential Diagnosis: Pituitary macroadenoma; Craniopharyngioma; Suprasellar meningioma; Chiasmal glioma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: Acetaminophen; bromocriptine
All Procedures: Visual field testing; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella with and without gadolinium; endocrine evaluation (if pituitary adenoma found); surgical resection of pituitary adenoma (if indicated)
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative visual field and ophthalmologic exam as soon as tolerated; then visual fields and ophthalmologic exams at 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, yearly for 5 years, and every 2 years thereafter. Repeat MRI of the sellar region at 6 months, 1 year, then yearly for several years.
Patient Education: You have a lesion near the optic chiasm (most likely a pituitary tumor) that is causing loss of peripheral (side) vision in both eyes—this explains your difficulty driving and recent accidents. Important points and next steps: - Neuroimaging (preferably MRI of the sellar region with and without gadolinium) is needed urgently to confirm the diagnosis and determine the size and exact location of the tumor. - If the MRI shows a pituitary tumor, you will need endocrine blood tests to check pituitary hormone function (e.g., prolactin, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, ACTH, LH/FSH) because some tumors affect hormone levels. - Treatment options depend on the tumor type and size: some (prolactin-secreting tumors) can be treated with medication (bromocriptine or similar); many compressive tumors require neurosurgical removal and sometimes postoperative radiation. - Vision may improve after treatment but recovery can be variable and depends on how long and how severe the compression has been; early treatment gives the best chance of visual recovery. - After treatment you will need regular follow-up: visual field and eye exams, periodic MRI scans, and endocrine monitoring. - For safety, avoid driving until your vision has been evaluated and cleared by your physician or eye specialist. If you have worsening vision, severe headache, nausea/vomiting, sudden visual loss, or any new neurologic symptoms, seek emergency care immediately.
Referrals: Neurosurgery (pituitary/sellar surgery) and Endocrinology; Ophthalmology follow-up for serial visual fields and exams; Neuroimaging (MRI) scheduling (radiology)
Work Restrictions: Avoid driving and operating heavy machinery until visual fields improve and cleared by ophthalmology/neurology; limit tasks requiring peripheral visual awareness; may require medical leave for surgery and recovery per treating physician.
Emergency Instructions: Seek urgent neuroimaging (MRI of the sella with and without gadolinium); if pituitary mass suspected or acute deterioration, arrange immediate neurosurgical evaluation (or CT if MRI unavailable) and endocrinologic assessment.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right occipital lobe infarction causing a dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia consistent with a retrochiasmal visual pathway lesion; risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and recent coronary bypass—recommend neuroimaging (MRI) if not already performed, vascular risk factor control and antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin), and visual rehabilitation (scanning training, prism lenses, reading aids) with repeat ophthalmologic/visual field evaluation in ~6 months.
Primary Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarction causing dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus; Hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarct (posterior cerebral artery ischemia); optic radiation lesion (temporal/parietal lobe stroke or tumor); lateral geniculate body or optic tract lesion (infarct, tumor, demyelination)
Severity: Dense
Laterality: Right
Complications: Left homonymous hemianopia (dense), reading difficulties and collision incidents while driving (recurrent bumps to left front fender)


Plan
All Medications: aspirin
Follow-Up Instructions: Repeat visual fields and ophthalmologic examination approximately 6 months after onset to assess for improvement.
Patient Education: You have a left homonymous hemianopia from a right occipital stroke. This means you have lost the left half of the visual field in both eyes, which causes trouble reading and bumping objects on the left. Key points and self-care: - This is due to a brain (retro‑chiasmal) injury — not an eye problem — and often from a stroke. Control vascular risks: blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, smoking cessation, and take prescribed antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin) as directed. - Expect limited spontaneous recovery; repeat visual field testing and eye exam about 6 months after onset to check for improvement. - Use practical strategies: use a ruler or line guide when reading; train scanning with large saccades toward the blind side; consciously scan the left side when walking or parking. - Ask your clinician about rehabilitation options: occupational therapy or vision rehabilitation, prism glasses to shift images, and structured scanning training. Vision restoration therapy is controversial and not proven. - Safety: avoid hazardous tasks until adapted (driving restrictions likely apply—check local regulations and discuss with your physician), modify home/garage layout to reduce left‑side obstacles, and consider assistance for activities that risk injury. - Seek prompt medical attention for any new neurologic symptoms (weakness, speech changes, severe headache) — these may indicate recurrent stroke.
Referrals: Neuroimaging (MRI) and neurology/stroke service referral.


CASE 65 — Transient Monocular Visual Loss
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Transient visual loss in the right eye x3 episodes over 3 weeks

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 65-year-old woman with transient monocular visual loss (three episodes over 3 weeks of 5–6 minutes of gray-out in the right eye) with risk factors hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Examination: VA 20/25 OD, 20/20 OS, normal pupils without RAPD, normal fields, mild nuclear sclerotic cataracts, and intravascular cholesterol embolus (Hollenhorst plaque) in right retinal arteriole. Clinical impression: retinal emboli from ipsilateral carotid/aortic atherosclerotic disease causing transient monocular visual loss; differential includes cardiac/aortic valvular embolic source and less likely giant cell arteritis (no headache, jaw claudication, or elevated inflammatory signs reported). Recommend urgent vascular and cardiac evaluation (carotid Doppler/ultrasound ± MR angiography, transthoracic and possibly transesophageal echocardiography), stroke risk factor optimization, and initiation of antiplatelet therapy unless a cardiac valvular source or indication for anticoagulation is identified; consider carotid endarterectomy or stenting if ipsilateral carotid stenosis ≥70% and patient is an appropriate surgical candidate. Follow-up with periodic carotid surveillance.
Primary Diagnosis: Retinal emboli secondary to right carotid stenosis causing transient monocular visual loss
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Thromboembolic retinal ischemia from carotid/aortic atherosclerotic disease (cholesterol/Hollenhorst plaque); Cardioembolic retinal emboli (valvular disease, atrial fibrillation); Giant cell arteritis; Ocular hypoperfusion (ocular ischemic syndrome/venous stasis retinopathy)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Stroke


Plan
All Medications: antihypertensive medication (unspecified), lipid-lowering medication (unspecified), aspirin (antiplatelet therapy—standard care if no embolic source found)
All Procedures: Carotid Doppler/ultrasound; MR angiography of carotids; Conventional angiography of carotids; Transthoracic echocardiography; Transesophageal echocardiography; Cardiac MR imaging; Temporal artery biopsy (if giant cell arteritis suspected); Carotid endarterectomy; Carotid stenting; Periodic noninvasive carotid surveillance (carotid Doppler or MR angiography)
Follow-Up Instructions: Medical supervision of stroke risk factors and periodic reevaluation of the carotid artery for restenosis with noninvasive studies (e.g., carotid Doppler or MR angiography).
Patient Education: You had brief episodes of vision loss in one eye due to tiny cholesterol emboli seen in the retinal vessels (Hollenhorst plaque). This most often means a source of plaque in the carotid arteries or aorta or rarely the heart. Important points: - This is a warning sign for stroke risk; prompt vascular and cardiac evaluation is needed (carotid Doppler/ultrasound or MRA, and echocardiography) and review of stroke risk factors. - Control cardiovascular risk factors: blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking cessation, diabetes control, and regular exercise as advised by your doctor. - You will likely be started on antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or equivalent) unless another specific cause requires different treatment. - If significant ipsilateral carotid stenosis is found, procedures such as carotid endarterectomy or stenting may be recommended to reduce stroke risk. - Seek immediate care for any new or persistent vision loss, weakness, numbness, slurred speech, or sudden severe headache. Follow up regularly with your ophthalmologist, primary care physician, and vascular/cardiac specialists as recommended.
Referrals: Carotid vascular evaluation (carotid Doppler/ultrasound and vascular surgery or neurovascular clinic); cardiology (transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac imaging); neurology/stroke service; rheumatology (if giant cell arteritis suspected)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 70-year-old man with a 4-week history of binocular diplopia, severe right retro-orbital pain early, and progressive right upper‑eyelid ptosis. Exam: VA 20/30 OD, 20/25 OS; pupils 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light and near with no RAPD; complete right ptosis with markedly reduced levator function; complete right third‑nerve motor palsy with loss of adduction, elevation, and depression, preserved abduction, and mild incyclodeviation on attempted depression consistent with intact CN IV and VI. Fundus: mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without optic nerve pathology. Past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Clinical picture consistent with an isolated, pupil‑sparing, complete ischemic third nerve palsy most likely secondary to microvascular ischemia from diabetes; recommend vascular risk factor control and observation with follow‑up at 1–2 months; consider neuroimaging only if no improvement by 3 months or if pupil involvement or other neurologic signs develop.

Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow at 1– to 2‑month intervals to monitor for improvement; expect resolution in 3–6 months. If no improvement by 3 months, obtain neuroimaging for a compressive lesion. If seen within 1 week of onset, observe closely at 24–48 hour intervals during the first week for delayed pupil involvement.
Patient Education: - This is most likely an ischemic (blood‑vessel related) third nerve palsy often seen with diabetes and hypertension; it causes eyelid droop (ptosis), double vision, and eye movement weakness but usually spares the pupil. - Control vascular risk factors: optimize blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol; stop smoking. - Expect gradual improvement: most ischemic third‑nerve palsies improve over 3–6 months; follow‑up visits every 1–2 months to monitor recovery. - If symptoms worsen (new or worsening pupil dilation, increasing pain, new neurologic symptoms) or there is no improvement by about 3 months, further testing (brain imaging/angiography) is recommended. - Temporary measures: consider patching or prism for diplopia and an eyelid taping/temporary ptosis correction for vision protection; discuss surgical options only if deficit persists after recovery period. - If age >55 with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness or systemic symptoms, testing for giant cell arteritis (ESR/CRP) should be done.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Partial left third cranial nerve palsy with pupillary involvement due to a left posterior communicating artery aneurysm confirmed by CT/CTA, MRI/MRA, and cerebral angiography; presenting with acute binocular diplopia, left frontal-periorbital pain, left ptosis (3 mm) and anisocoria (left pupil larger and minimally reactive).
Primary Diagnosis: Partial third nerve palsy due to posterior communicating artery aneurysm
Differential Diagnosis: Posterior communicating artery aneurysm compressive third nerve palsy; Diabetic (ischemic) microvascular third nerve palsy; Cavernous sinus lesion (e.g., thrombosis, fistula or tumor) causing CN III dysfunction
Severity: Severe
Laterality: left
Complications: Aneurysmal rupture with subarachnoid hemorrhage leading to high morbidity and mortality


Plan
All Procedures: CT/CTA; MRI/MRA; cerebral angiography (catheter-based DSA); surgical or endovascular repair of posterior communicating artery aneurysm; ocular patching for diplopia
Follow-Up Instructions: Patching the eye to relieve the diplopia.
Patient Education: Pupil-involving third nerve palsy from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm is serious and requires urgent vascular treatment (surgical clipping or endovascular repair) to prevent rupture. You may experience double vision and a drooping eyelid; patching one eye can relieve diplopia temporarily. Prompt neuroimaging (CT/CTA, MRI/MRA) and cerebral angiography are needed to confirm the aneurysm and plan repair. Report any worsening headache, sudden vision change, increased drooping, weakness, numbness, or new neurological symptoms immediately (emergency department). After aneurysm repair, vision and eye movement recovery may be partial and gradual; follow-up with neurosurgery and neuro-ophthalmology for monitoring, possible prism or strabismus surgery later, and rehabilitation is important.
Referrals: Neurosurgery / Cerebrovascular surgery for aneurysm repair (surgical or endovascular)
Emergency Instructions: Surgery or endovascular therapy to repair the aneurysm is necessary to prevent aneurysmal rupture, which carries a high morbidity and mortality. Patching the eye to relieve the diplopia is often required.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Decompensation of a longstanding (congenital) right fourth cranial nerve palsy causing a right hypertropia worse on left gaze and right head tilt, with large vertical fusional amplitudes (10 PD), 4° right excyclodeviation, chronic head tilt to the left on old photos, and acute symptomatic vertical diplopia due to recent decompensation. Observation, prism correction, or strabismus surgery may be considered.
Primary Diagnosis: Decompensation of old right fourth cranial nerve (superior oblique) palsy
Differential Diagnosis: Right fourth cranial nerve palsy (superior oblique paresis); myasthenia gravis; thyroid eye disease
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Procedures: Observation; prism correction; strabismus surgery
Patient Education: This is a long‑standing (congenital) right fourth cranial nerve palsy that has recently decompensated, causing vertical double vision. Because your brain has compensated for years, symptoms can often be managed without surgery. Options include observation, prism glasses to align the images, or strabismus surgery if prisms are insufficient or symptoms persist. Measures to help now: adopt the habitual head tilt that reduces double vision, use a patch or occlusion for severe diplopia when needed, and avoid activities requiring precise depth perception until vision is stable. If you develop new worsening, pain, headache, eyelid droop, facial numbness, or other neurological symptoms, seek prompt medical evaluation. Follow-up with an ophthalmologist/strabismus specialist will determine need for prisms, continued observation, or surgical correction.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 56-year-old man with a 3-month history of binocular horizontal diplopia, worse at distance and on left gaze. Exam: 20/20 OU, full color vision, pupils equal and reactive, no RAPD, full confrontational fields, 4 PD esotropia at distance (no ET at near), nil on right gaze, 8 PD ET on left gaze, 4 PD ET on up/down gaze. Left underaction of abduction consistent with left lateral rectus paresis; decreased sensation over left forehead and slightly depressed left corneal reflex; no ptosis; slit-lamp and fundus normal, no papilledema. Clinical picture consistent with a left sixth nerve palsy with involvement of the left ophthalmic (V1) trigeminal branch. MRI with contrast demonstrated a cavernous sinus meningioma. Impression: Left sixth nerve palsy and left V1 trigeminal neuropathy due to cavernous sinus meningioma. Plan: Neuroimaging confirmed lesion; manage underlying tumor (surgery/radiation/observation as indicated); symptomatic diplopia control with patching/prisms or early ipsilateral medial rectus botulinum injection; consider strabismus surgery if residual stable deviation. Follow for further neurologic/ophthalmic deficits.
Primary Diagnosis: Left sixth nerve palsy secondary to cavernous sinus meningioma
Secondary Diagnoses: Meningioma of the cavernous sinus
Differential Diagnosis: Left sixth nerve palsy due to cavernous sinus lesion (meningioma) — compressive cavernous sinus tumors/lesions; Ischemic (vasculopathic) microvascular sixth nerve palsy; Cavernous sinus thrombosis or carotid-cavernous fistula (inflammatory/vascular compressive); Myasthenia gravis (less likely)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: oral agents (for diabetes)
All Procedures: MRI with contrast; lumbar puncture (in some cases); neuroimaging (MRI with contrast); patching; prisms; botulinum injection into the ipsilateral medial rectus; strabismus surgery
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe for recurrence of further neurologic and ophthalmologic deficits depending on the etiology; provide symptomatic diplopia treatment as needed (patching, prisms, or surgery when chronic/stable); consider early botulinum injection to ipsilateral medial rectus; arrange neuroimaging and further neurologic evaluation if progressive or unresolved.
Patient Education: You have a left sixth nerve palsy caused by a meningioma in the cavernous sinus. This explains your horizontal double vision (worse when looking left and at distance) and the numbness on the left forehead. Treatment focuses on the tumor (which may be observed, treated with surgery or radiation) and on relieving the double vision in the short term with patching, Fresnel prism or temporary botulinum injection to the opposing muscle; permanent strabismus surgery is an option if misalignment persists. Neuroimaging (MRI with contrast) and ongoing neurologic follow‑up are important to monitor the lesion and any new symptoms. If you develop worsening vision, new weakness, severe headache, fever, or increased double vision, seek urgent care. Control your diabetes and attend all follow‑up appointments to optimize recovery.
Referrals: Neuro-ophthalmology / neurology for MRI evaluation and management of cavernous sinus lesion

Extraocular Movements: Paresis of both lateral rectus muscles; ductions suggest bilateral LR weakness with gaze-holding fatigability (esotropia worse on lateral gaze; increased separation of images on sustained left/right gaze); eventual left hypertropia on prolonged upgaze.
Slit Lamp Exam Description: Slit-lamp and fundus exams were normal.
Fundus Exam – Optic Nerve: cup-to-disc ratio 0.3 with sharp, well-defined disc margins (normal optic nerve)
Fundus Exam – Macula: Normal
Fundus Exam – Vessels: Normal
Fundus Exam – Periphery: No peripheral retinal lesions; peripheral fundus normal


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 57-year-old woman with 6 months of fatigable, fluctuating diplopia and bilateral ptosis with enhanced ptosis, bilateral lateral rectus pareses, orbicularis oculi weakness, and worsening with sustained gaze. Tensilon test produced objective improvement. AChR antibodies negative, TSH normal, chest CT negative for thymoma. Findings are most consistent with ocular myasthenia gravis.
Primary Diagnosis: Ocular myasthenia gravis
Secondary Diagnoses: Pernicious anemia
Differential Diagnosis: Myasthenia gravis (ocular); Bilateral sixth nerve palsies (bilateral abducens neuropathy); Oculomotor (III) palsy with pupil-sparing variant
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: generalization of myasthenia gravis (risk of progression from ocular to generalized MG)


Plan
All Medications: B12 (monthly injections), edrophonium (Tensilon), neostigmine (Prostigmin), pyridostigmine (Mestinon), prednisone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis.
All Procedures: Tensilon (edrophonium) test; CT scan of the chest (mediastinal CT)
Follow-Up Instructions: Close supervision of medications; inform physician immediately if dysphagia, respiratory difficulty, or limb weakness develop; return for follow-up monitoring for symptom progression and medication side effects; obtain mediastinal CT/MRI if not done and periodic reassessment for generalization.
Patient Education: You have ocular myasthenia gravis (MG), a condition in which the nerves that tell your eyelid and eye‑movement muscles to work do not communicate reliably, causing drooping eyelids and double vision that often worsen through the day and improve with rest. Key points and actions: - Symptoms: intermittent ptosis (lid droop), variable double vision that worsens with sustained use and later in the day; report any new difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing, or limb weakness immediately. - Tests and results: diagnosis supported by improvement with Tensilon (edrophonium) and clinical exam; AChR antibodies were negative and chest CT showed no thymoma, but serology can be negative in ocular MG. - Medications and effects: short‑acting anticholinesterase (eg, pyridostigmine) can help eyelid and sometimes eye‑movement weakness; corticosteroids are effective if symptoms are troublesome or do not respond to anticholinesterase. Discuss side effects and monitoring with your doctor. - Eye safety and symptom management: use rest breaks, avoid prolonged visual tasks when symptomatic, consider patching one eye or prism lenses for diplopia, and eyelid crutches on glasses for persistent ptosis if needed. Ice pack test may transiently improve ptosis. - Follow‑up/testing: regular follow‑up with neurology and neuro‑ophthalmology; repeat testing (AChR, single‑fiber EMG) or chest imaging if symptoms change. Monitor thyroid function as recommended. - When to seek urgent care: sudden worsening of double vision, new generalized weakness, drooling, difficulty swallowing, speaking, or any breathing trouble — these may signal generalized or life‑threatening MG. - Lifestyle: avoid medications known to aggravate MG (discuss with your physician/pharmacist), avoid overheating and excessive fatigue, and inform other providers of your diagnosis. - Prognosis: many patients remain limited to ocular symptoms but some may develop generalized MG (most commonly within 2–3 years); treatment can reduce this risk. Regular communication with your care team is important.
Emergency Instructions: Inform physician immediately if symptoms such as dysphagia, respiratory involvement, or extremity weakness develop.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 35-year-old woman with prior hyperthyroidism treated with radioactive iodine presents with a 2-month history of bilateral eye irritation, proptosis, lid retraction and lid lag, and binocular constant vertical diplopia. Examination: VA 20/25 OU, normal color vision and fields, pupils equal and reactive without RAPD. Motility: left hypertropia 4 PD in primary gaze increasing on up and down gaze; esotropia ~5 PD comitant; ductions show limitation of elevation and depression OU and abduction OU (worse OS), consistent with restrictive myopathy. Hertel: 22 mm OD, 24 mm OS at 95 mm base. Slit lamp: mild punctate keratopathy OU; fundus normal. Clinical picture most consistent with thyroid orbitopathy (Graves’ ophthalmopathy) with restrictive EOM involvement and proptosis; alternate diagnoses such as myasthenia gravis or orbital inflammatory disease are less likely given lid retraction, proptosis, and pattern of restrictive motility. Recommend thyroid function assessment, orbital imaging (CT/MRI) to document EOM enlargement if needed, conservative ocular surface management (lubrication, head elevation, dark glasses), smoking cessation, and observation/consider systemic corticosteroids or orbital radiation only if signs of active severe inflammation or optic neuropathy; manage diplopia with patching or prisms short-term and defer strabismus or eyelid surgery until disease is inactive for ≥6–12 months.
Primary Diagnosis: Thyroid orbitopathy
Secondary Diagnoses: Hyperthyroidism (history; treated with radioactive iodine), Dry eye / punctate keratopathy, Diplopia (due to restrictive EOM involvement), Lid retraction/lid lag, Proptosis
Differential Diagnosis: Thyroid orbitopathy (Graves’ ophthalmopathy); orbital pseudotumor/infiltrative orbitopathy; myasthenia gravis
Severity: Mild to moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Diplopia, exposure keratopathy (mild punctate keratopathy), proptosis, potential optic neuropathy (risk)


Plan
All Medications: thyroid supplements; methylcellulose artificial tears (day); lubricating ointment (night)
Follow-Up Instructions: Close ophthalmologic supervision with monitoring of visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and fundus for optic neuropathy; regular checks for corneal epithelial breakdown; coordinated follow-up with endocrinology and ophthalmology over several years with treatment sequencing as needed.
Patient Education: Stop smoking. Use lubricating artificial tears during the day and ointment at night for eye irritation; consider taping eyelids shut or goggles at night for severe exposure. Elevate head of bed and avoid full recumbency. Wear dark glasses with side protection for photophobia. Patch one eye or use prism/temporary occlusion for symptomatic diplopia. Follow thyroid care with your endocrinologist and have regular ophthalmology follow-up to monitor for worsening exposure keratopathy, optic neuropathy, or changes in vision. Seek urgent care for severe pain, sudden vision loss, increasing redness or discharge, or inability to close the eyes.
Referrals: Endocrinology
Work Restrictions: Avoid heavy lifting/straining and activities that worsen eye exposure; avoid smoke exposure; limit tasks requiring binocular depth perception/precise near work while diplopia persists; wear protective eyewear and take frequent breaks to use lubricating drops.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate care for severe exposure keratopathy, severe proptosis or globe luxation, sudden vision loss or worsening vision, new or worsening pain, signs of optic neuropathy (decreased visual acuity, color vision changes, visual field defects), or corneal epithelial breakdown.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Isolated, idiopathic tonic (Adie’s) pupil of the right eye characterized by a dilated (6 mm) right pupil with poor segmental light reaction, vermiform iris movements, light–near dissociation, and cholinergic denervation supersensitivity consistent with an Adie’s tonic pupil; reassurance and observation recommended.
Primary Diagnosis: Isolated, idiopathic tonic pupil
Differential Diagnosis: Third nerve (oculomotor) palsy; Pharmacologic mydriasis; Tonic (Adie’s) pupil; Iris structural damage
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: None expected; usually no significant complications—primarily cosmetic anisocoria and possible accommodative paresis/near vision difficulties.


Plan
All Medications: Pilocarpine (0.125%), Pilocarpine 1%
All Procedures: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain; slit-lamp biomicroscopy; pupillary testing with 0.125% pilocarpine (pharmacologic testing)
Follow-Up Instructions: Reassurance; no specific treatment required. Use unequal bifocal reading aids or unilateral frosted bifocal segment for accommodative paresis if symptomatic. Monitor over time; note that pupil may shrink and fellow eye may become involved (~4%/yr). If bilateral involvement occurs, obtain serologic testing for syphilis and evaluate for Holmes–Adie syndrome (diminished reflexes, orthostatic hypotension).
Patient Education: Diagnosis: isolated tonic (Adie’s) pupil — a benign problem where one pupil is larger, reacts poorly to light, but slowly constricts for near vision. What caused it: likely idiopathic denervation of the iris sphincter (sometimes follows local injury or viral illness); not a brain tumor. Symptoms to expect: persistent unequal pupils, light sensitivity or glare, possible difficulty with near focusing; vision and color usually normal. Tests/what was done: eye exam, slit-lamp showed characteristic vermiform iris movements; brain MRI was normal; dilute pilocarpine can confirm diagnosis if needed. Treatment and prognosis: no specific medical or surgical treatment required. Many cases improve over time; accommodative weakness may partially recover. Reassurance is appropriate. Self-care and aids: wear sunglasses for light sensitivity; use reading glasses, unequal bifocals, or a unilateral frosted bifocal segment if near vision is bothersome. When to seek care: return promptly for new symptoms — eyelid droop, double vision, sudden vision loss, worsening headache, or if the pupil changes rapidly — or if bilateral involvement or systemic symptoms (fainting, dizziness, numbness) occur.
Work Restrictions: None — no work restrictions; reassurance and routine follow-up only.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 50-year-old man with 3 weeks of left frontotemporal/periorbital headache and 2 mm left ptosis. Pupils 4 mm OD and 3 mm OS in light, 5 mm OD and 3 mm OS in dark (anisocoria greater in dark). Both pupils reactive to light and near; no RAPD. Cocaine 10%: marked dilation OD, poor dilation OS, confirming Horner syndrome. Hydroxyamphetamine 1%: full dilation OD, poor dilation OS, localizing to a postganglionic (third-order) lesion. MR angiography demonstrated a dissecting aneurysm of the high cervical internal carotid artery. Diagnosis: left postganglionic Horner’s syndrome secondary to spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection. Managed medically with 3 months of warfarin followed by aspirin.
Primary Diagnosis: Postganglionic Horner’s syndrome due to spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Horner syndrome (postganglionic from internal carotid dissection); Physiologic anisocoria (with coincidental ptosis e.g., levator dehiscence); Cavernous sinus pathology (thrombosis, neoplasm, or infection causing third‑nerve/ophthalmic involvement)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: Transient ischemic attacks; retinal artery occlusion or ischemic optic neuropathy; diplopia from cavernous sinus involvement; neck bruit or swelling; other cranial neuropathies


Plan
All Medications: cocaine 10% topical, hydroxyamphetamine 1% (Paredrine) topical, Coumadin (warfarin), aspirin, apraclonidine 0.5–1% topical
All Procedures: Topical cocaine 10% instillation in both eyes; Hydroxyamphetamine 1% (Paredrine) instillation in both eyes; Magnetic resonance angiography (MR angiography) of the carotid artery.
Follow-Up Instructions: Close observation with ongoing follow-up to monitor for development of additional neurologic or medical signs or symptoms; treat underlying etiology as indicated and arrange appropriate neurovascular follow-up (e.g., vascular/neurosurgery and interval imaging as directed by treating team).
Patient Education: You have Horner’s syndrome on the left, caused by a tear (dissection) in the left internal carotid artery. This explains your drooping eyelid, smaller pupil on that side, and the headaches. Horner’s syndrome itself does not need treatment, but the underlying carotid dissection does because it can cause stroke. Treatment typically involves blood-thinning medication (you were treated with warfarin for 3 months and then aspirin) to prevent clot-related complications. You should watch for any new or worsening symptoms — sudden weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, vision loss, new or severe headache, or worsening neck/face pain — and seek emergency care if they occur. Follow-up imaging and neurologic/vascular care are important to monitor the dissection and recovery. Eye symptoms (mild ptosis and small pupil) often improve as the nerve recovers but may persist; no eye surgery is needed now.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 24-year-old woman with long-standing daily headaches and blurred vision found to have unilateral right-sided pharmacologic mydriasis: right pupil 8 mm, nonreactive to light or near; left pupil 4 mm, briskly reactive. Normal visual acuity (20/20 OU), full visual fields, normal motility, no ptosis, normal slit-lamp and fundus exam. Findings and lack of tonic segmental change or third-nerve palsy signs support diagnosis of pharmacologic mydriasis; no treatment required other than reassurance and follow-up to document resolution.
Primary Diagnosis: Pharmacologic mydriasis
Differential Diagnosis: Pharmacologic mydriasis; Third cranial nerve palsy; Tonic (Adie) pupil; Traumatic/structural iris sphincter damage
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: None


Plan
All Medications: medications only for her headaches
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up to ensure resolution of the symptoms.
Patient Education: Explain that the enlarged, nonreactive pupil is most likely caused by accidental exposure to a dilating (mydriatic) medication rather than nerve damage; reassure her this is benign and usually resolves on its own over days to weeks. Review possible sources of exposure (topical anticholinergic or adrenergic agents, contaminated hands or instruments, scopolamine patches, ophthalmic drops, topical anesthetics or certain antibiotic preparations) and advise avoiding contact with eye drops or handling medications without gloves, wash hands thoroughly, and avoid rubbing the eyes. Recommend symptomatic measures — wear sunglasses for photophobia and avoid driving if vision is impaired. Arrange short-term follow-up to confirm gradual return of the pupil to normal and to re-evaluate if symptoms worsen (new diplopia, ptosis, vision loss, severe headache) or do not improve.


CASE 76 — Leukocoria
====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Leukocoria (white pupil) of the left eye noticed for 3 months
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "funny"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 9-month-old girl with 3 months of progressive leukocoria of the left eye noted by family; born 2 weeks premature, otherwise healthy, no systemic symptoms, no family history of childhood ocular disease. Parents report left eye “looks funny”; child fixes and follows with right eye but not left and strongly objects to occlusion of the right eye.
History Narrative: The family of a 9-month-old girl noted that her left eye has looked “funny” for the last 3 months. The girl’s pediatrician detected leukocoria and immediately referred her to an ophthalmologist for evaluation and treatment. The child is an otherwise healthy 9-month-old with a negative review of systems with the exception of the white pupil. She was born 2 weeks prematurely and had a birth weight of 6 lb., 8 oz. There is no history of systemic disease or exposure to animals, and there is no family history of childhood ocular disease. Examination reveals a normal right eye, though only the posterior pole can be seen on retinal examination. In the left eye, a white, vascular lesion is obvious with a surrounding large serous retinal detachment. The child fixes and follows well with her right eye, but does not fix or follow with her left eye. Strong objection to occlusion of the right eye is noted.
Symptom Onset: 3 months prior to presentation
Symptom Duration: 3 months

Characteristics: Bilateral retinoblastoma with a large vascular white intraocular tumor in the left eye causing a massive serous (exudative) retinal detachment and a smaller inferior retinal tumor in the right eye; leukocoria, vitreous seeding, no fixation in left eye, fixation with right eye; onset noted at ~6 months, diagnosed at 9 months.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: White pupil (leukocoria); poor vision in the left eye (does not fix or follow); strabismus/objection to occlusion of the right eye noted (suggesting possible deviation); decreased visual behavior in affected eye; none systemic (negative review of systems)
Previous Episodes: None
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant — monocular vision with right eye only fixation; left eye nonfunctional and enucleation planned, requiring protective measures and activity modification (risk of depth perception loss, need for safety glasses, ongoing follow-up).
Systemic Symptoms: Negative review of systems except for the white pupil
Risk Factors: Hereditary RB1 mutation (germline RB1) — family history negative but bilateral disease and young age suggest germline mutation; prior premature birth (2 weeks early) — minor; monocular status after enucleation increases risk for injury; increased lifetime risk of secondary malignancies (soft-tissue and bony sarcomas) in hereditary cases

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Peripheral retina: right eye — small tumor in inferior periphery; left eye — large vascular mass with surrounding extensive serous (exudative) peripheral retinal detachment (massive peripheral involvement)


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Bilateral retinoblastoma: left eye with a massive vascular intraocular tumor associated with a large serous/exudative retinal detachment and no fixation or visual behavior; right eye with a small inferior retinal tumor not apparent on office exam but identified on examination under anesthesia. Left eye has no visual potential and is recommended for enucleation with attention to obtaining a long optic nerve segment. Right eye amenable to globe-sparing therapy (chemotherapy ± focal treatments such as laser, cryotherapy, or plaque radiation; consider intra-arterial/intravitreal/periocular routes as indicated). MRI of head and orbits obtained to evaluate for extraocular extension and trilateral disease; genetic testing for RB1 and counseling recommended for prognosis and surveillance. Close follow-up with examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months until age 5 if germline mutation present, then less frequent long-term surveillance; counsel on contralateral eye protection and long-term risk of secondary malignancies in hereditary cases.
Primary Diagnosis: Bilateral retinoblastoma
Differential Diagnosis: Retinoblastoma; Coats’ disease; Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV); Toxocariasis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: orbital recurrence, optic nerve invasion, extraocular extension, metastasis (including CNS/pineal trilateral disease), secondary nonocular malignancies (soft-tissue and bony sarcomas), vision loss of affected eye, need for enucleation


Plan
All Procedures: Exam under anesthesia; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head and orbits; Ultrasound (B-scan and A-scan); Genetic testing/counseling (RB1); Enucleation of left eye with long optic nerve segment; Chemotherapy (systemic intravenous; possible intra-arterial/periocular/intravitreal depending on indication); Focal therapies to right eye (laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, radioactive plaque therapy); Pathologic examination of enucleated eye; Follow-up examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months (surveillance)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months until age 5 (if RB1 germline mutation confirmed), then frequent examinations for several more years with annual eye exam thereafter; examine enucleated socket at each visit; long-term surveillance for secondary malignancies and advise eye-protective measures (polycarbonate safety glasses) and patient/family education on eye safety.
Patient Education: Protect the remaining (right) eye and reduce risk of injury: use polycarbonate safety glasses for the child during play and avoid situations with high risk of eye trauma. Importance of follow-up: frequent examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months until age 5 (more frequent review if RB1 germline mutation confirmed), continued periodic exams thereafter (annual once stable) to monitor for tumor recurrence in the remaining eye and orbital recurrence in the enucleated socket. Genetic counseling and testing: RB1 testing is recommended for all patients to determine hereditary risk, guide surveillance of the child and screening of siblings/parents, and inform long-term risk of secondary malignancies. Signs to watch for at home: new white reflex, new eye turn (strabismus), redness, pain, decreased visual attention or fixation—report promptly to the ophthalmologist. Long-term risks and surveillance: if hereditary disease is present, there is increased lifetime risk of nonocular secondary malignancies (particularly soft-tissue and bone sarcomas); long-term medical follow-up and education about this risk are necessary. Rehabilitation and prosthetic care: after enucleation, prosthetic eye fitting and cosmetic rehabilitation will be arranged; socket care instructions and regular prosthesis maintenance visits will be provided. Treatment expectations: left eye enucleation is recommended for extensive tumor with no visual potential; the right eye may require chemotherapy (intravenous, intra-arterial, periocular, or intravitreal) and focal treatments (laser, cryotherapy, plaque) depending on tumor response. Emergency instructions: seek immediate care for fever, sudden swelling, or signs suggesting orbital recurrence or infection.
Referrals: Genetic counseling and genetic testing for RB1; pediatric oncology for chemotherapy consultation; oculoplastics/orbital surgeon for enucleation planning; radiation oncology if plaque therapy considered; pediatric neurosurgery/oncology for evaluation if MRI suggests CNS involvement.
Emergency Instructions: Urgent ophthalmologic evaluation for suspected retinoblastoma; arrange examination under anesthesia and MRI of orbits/brain promptly; refer to pediatric ocular oncology for expedited genetic testing and management; if advanced intraocular tumor with no visual potential, plan enucleation without delay; protect the fellow eye and advise emergent return for any new redness, swelling, pain, or visual change.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Anisometropic amblyopia of the right eye due to uncorrected hyperopia (cycloplegic refraction +3.00 OD, +1.00 OS) with reduced recognition acuity OD (HOTV 20/50 OD vs 20/30 OS). Orthotropic at distance with 4Δ exophoria at near. Stereoacuity 60" on Titmus. Recommend full cycloplegic spectacle correction (or symmetric reduced hyperopic correction), recheck in several weeks–months; if acuity does not improve, institute amblyopia therapy (patching of sound eye 2 hours daily or optical penalization with atropine) and consider atropine to encourage spectacle wear if needed. Continue follow-up and maintenance patching as indicated until visual stability around age 7–8.
Primary Diagnosis: Anisometropic amblyopia in the right eye due to uncorrected hyperopia.
Secondary Diagnoses: Anisometropic hyperopia (right > left) leading to anisometropic amblyopia; hyperopia (+3.00 OD, +1.00 OS); exophoria 4 PD at near; decreased visual acuity OD (20/50) — anisometropic amblyopia due to uncorrected hyperopia.
Differential Diagnosis: Anisometropic/refractive amblyopia; Strabismic amblyopia; Deprivational (media-opacity) amblyopia; Poor effort/functional vision loss
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Occlusion amblyopia (iatrogenic)


Plan
All Medications: cyclopentolate 1% (cycloplegic) atropine (topical) spectacle correction (glasses)
All Procedures: Cycloplegic refraction with 1% cyclopentolate; HOTV visual acuity testing; Allen figure screening; Titmus stereoacuity testing; ocular motility exam (ductions/versions, cover testing); spectacle prescription/placement of hyperopic correction; trial atropine cycloplegia for spectacle adaptation; occlusion therapy (patching) as amblyopia treatment; atropine penalization; follow-up ophthalmologic examinations.
Follow-Up Instructions: Return to ophthalmology for follow-up several weeks to months after starting spectacles to assess visual acuity; continue amblyopia therapy as indicated and monitor for recurrence with periodic exams and updated refractions (maintenance patching may be needed until age 7–8).
Patient Education: Explain that the child has anisometropic amblyopia (weaker vision in the right eye caused by uncorrected farsightedness) and that early treatment improves the chance of recovery. Initial treatment is full-time glasses to correct the unequal refractive error; many children improve with glasses alone. If vision does not normalize, additional therapy will be recommended such as patching the better eye for a prescribed daily duration or optical penalization with atropine drops to encourage use of the amblyopic eye. Emphasize the need for regular follow-up visits to monitor vision and refraction, that spectacle prescriptions will likely change as he grows, and that treatment must be followed consistently to avoid permanent vision loss or recurrence. Reassure the family that most cases respond well to timely treatment and outline potential surgical options only if non‑surgical measures fail or a structural problem is found.
Referrals: Pediatric ophthalmology (ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right superior oblique palsy with chronic left head tilt and mild facial asymmetry.
Primary Diagnosis: Right superior oblique palsy with chronic left head tilt and mild facial asymmetry
Differential Diagnosis: Superior oblique palsy; Brown’s syndrome; Dissociated vertical deviation; Sternocleidomastoid (nonocular) torticollis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: - Over- or under-correction of strabismus requiring additional surgery - Development of a mild to moderate Brown’s syndrome (limitation of elevation in adduction), possibly persistent - Amblyopia may develop or persist before or after surgery


Plan
All Procedures: occlusion prism dissociation testing cycloplegic refraction fundus examination neuroimaging of the brain and orbit vertical prism therapy inferior oblique myectomy inferior oblique recession superior oblique tuck strabismus surgery on superior and/or inferior oblique muscles and rectus muscle surgery periodic ophthalmologic evaluations with fusion, stereopsis, and visual acuity testing
Follow-Up Instructions: Periodic ophthalmologic evaluations with attention to fusion, stereopsis, and visual acuity to detect, prevent, and treat amblyopia; advise parents preoperatively about risk of over/under-correction and possible need for additional surgery; monitor for postoperative Brown’s syndrome and for development of diplopia, with further management as needed.
Patient Education: Explain that the tilted head is most likely from a congenital weakness of the right superior oblique (an eye muscle), not a neck problem. Reassure that this is common, often long-standing, and may not need treatment if the child has single vision and good function. Describe signs to watch for (new double vision, worsening head tilt, decreased vision, abnormal eye movements), and advise return for follow-up if these occur. Discuss treatment options briefly: glasses or small vertical prism can help mild cases; surgery (usually weakening the inferior oblique or strengthening the superior oblique) is used for larger or symptomatic deviations to improve head posture and double vision. Explain surgery risks: over- or undercorrection, possible temporary or persistent limitation of eye elevation (Brown’s syndrome), and the potential need for further surgery. Emphasize importance of periodic eye exams to monitor vision, binocular function, and detect or treat amblyopia early.
Referrals: Pediatrician (if not already involved) for coordination and any systemic evaluation; Neurology/neuroimaging (brain and orbit) if superior oblique palsy suspected to be acquired or timing unclear; Pediatric orthopedics/physical therapy only if sternocleidomastoid or musculoskeletal cause suspected; Pediatric ophthalmology/strabismus surgery consult for consideration of prism management or surgical planning.


CASE 79 — Aniridia
==================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: "jiggling eyes" and large pupils noted since first month of life
DURATION: Since first month of life
LATERALITY: bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "jiggling eyes"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 9-month-old boy referred for “jiggling eyes” and large pupils noted during the first month of life. Parents report photophobia (closes eyes in bright sunlight) and reduced visual behavior compared with siblings. Born at term with no perinatal complications. Past medical history notable for hypospadias repair 2 months earlier and developmental delay. No family history of ophthalmologic or medical problems. On exam he fix‑and‑follows with abnormal fixation, low‑amplitude/high‑frequency horizontal pendular nystagmus, large pupils with only small peripheral iris remnants, peripheral corneal opacification and vascularization, bilateral anterior pyramidal cataracts, and signs of foveal hypoplasia. Genetic testing revealed 11p13 deletion.
History Narrative: A 9-month-old boy whose parents noted “jiggling eyes” and large pupils during the first month of life, who closes his eyes in bright sunlight and appears to have reduced vision compared with his two older siblings. Born at term after prenatal care with no perinatal complications. Medical history notable for hypospadias repair 2 months earlier and developmental delay. No family history of ophthalmologic or medical problems; parents and two older siblings examined and found normal. On exam he can fix and follow but with abnormal fixation and a low-amplitude/high-frequency horizontal pendular nystagmus. Findings include peripheral corneal opacification and vascularization, only a very small peripheral remnant of iris in both eyes, anterior pyramidal cataracts bilaterally, and absence of an obvious umbo or foveal pigmentation on retinal exam. Genetic testing showed an 11p13 deletion.
Symptom Onset: first month of life
Symptom Duration: Since the first month of life
Progression: Progressive risk of corneal opacification, cataract formation, and glaucoma leading to potential future vision loss; Wilms' tumor most likely by age 3 (monitor with periodic abdominal ultrasound)
Characteristics: Panocular congenital anomaly with near-total iris hypoplasia (aniridia), foveal hypoplasia causing reduced visual acuity and infantile pendular nystagmus, photophobia, large pupils, peripheral corneal opacification and vascularization, bilateral anterior pyramidal cataracts, risk of glaucoma and ectopia lentis; may be sporadic or autosomal dominant (PAX6) and associated with 11p13 deletion (WAGR: Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, retardation).


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Bright sunlight (photophobia)
Alleviating Factors: Wears sunglasses or shaded contact lenses to reduce photophobia
Associated Symptoms: photophobia, nystagmus, decreased visual behavior/poor vision, developmental delay, hypospadias (genitourinary abnormality)
Previous Episodes: None reported
Prior Treatments: Hypospadias repair two months earlier.
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant—photophobia causes eye closing in bright light, nystagmus and reduced visual function/foveal hypoplasia likely impair visual tasks; developmental delay further limits daily activities and indicates need for low-vision/early intervention.
Systemic Symptoms: hypospadias; developmental delay; at risk for Wilms’ tumor (11p13 deletion)
Recent Travel: No recent travel
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: No known contacts with similar symptoms.
Risk Factors: Sporadic aniridia with 11p13 deletion (WAGR syndrome): developmental delay, genitourinary abnormality (hypospadias), and high risk of Wilms tumor; family history negative (sporadic), PAX6-related genetic defect.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Sporadic aniridia with panocular involvement manifesting as severe iris hypoplasia, bilateral anterior pyramidal cataracts, corneal opacification/vascularization, foveal hypoplasia causing infantile nystagmus and reduced visual behavior. Associated developmental delay and history of hypospadias indicate WAGR syndrome; genetic testing confirms 11p13 deletion. High risk for Wilms tumor — recommend periodic abdominal ultrasound surveillance until ~3 years of age, genetic and pediatric oncology/genetics consultation, regular ophthalmologic monitoring for glaucoma, progressive corneal disease and cataract, and early low-vision/educational intervention.
Primary Diagnosis: Sporadic aniridia
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypospadias (status post repair); Developmental delay; Foveal hypoplasia; Corneal opacification/vascularization; Anterior pyramidal cataracts; Nystagmus; 11p13 deletion (WAGR syndrome risk)
Differential Diagnosis: Aniridia (congenital) — includes PAX6 mutation or 11p13 deletion/WAGR syndrome; Foveal hypoplasia causing infantile nystagmus; Congenital cataract with associated nystagmus; Peters anomaly/corneal dystrophy with corneal opacification and photophobia
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Visual loss - Congenital/infantile nystagmus - Corneal opacification and vascularization (progressive) - Cataracts (including anterior pyramidal cataract; progressive) - Glaucoma - Ectopia lentis - Foveal hypoplasia (leading to reduced acuity) - Colobomas - Increased risk of Wilms’ tumor (especially with 11p13 deletion/WAGR) - Systemic associations in WAGR: genitourinary abnormalities, developmental delay/mental retardation


Plan
All Procedures: hypospadias repair abdominal ultrasound screening (serial) abdominal MRI if ultrasound abnormal renal biopsy if MRI suggests Wilms' tumor genetic consultation/testing (11p13 deletion / PAX6 testing) pediatric oncology referral if Wilms' tumor confirmed periodic ophthalmologic screening examinations low-vision evaluation and early childhood educational intervention
Follow-Up Instructions: Periodic ophthalmologic screening examinations to monitor for progressive corneal opacification, cataract and glaucoma; regular abdominal ultrasound examinations (performed/coordinated by pediatrician) until ~3 years of age to screen for Wilms’ tumor (with MRI and oncology referral if abnormalities found); early childhood educational intervention and low-vision evaluation.
Patient Education: - Explain aniridia: a rare condition where the iris is absent or underdeveloped, causing light sensitivity, nystagmus, and reduced vision. - Discuss associated eye risks: progressive corneal scarring/vascularization, cataract, glaucoma, and foveal hypoplasia that can worsen vision; emphasize need for regular ophthalmic exams. - Explain systemic risk: because this is sporadic aniridia with an 11p13 deletion and genitourinary abnormalities/developmental delay (WAGR features), there is a high risk of Wilms’ tumor in early childhood. - Surveillance plan: arrange regular abdominal ultrasounds and physical exams (typically until ~3 years of age) per pediatrician; MRI and oncology referral if ultrasound abnormality is found. - Symptom management: use sunglasses or shaded contact lenses for photophobia; consider low-vision aids as needed. - Genetic counseling: recommend referral to a geneticist for testing, family counseling, and discussion of recurrence risk. - Developmental support: refer for early childhood intervention and low-vision services/education.
Referrals: genetics consultation; pediatrician (for abdominal ultrasound screening and follow-up); pediatric oncologist if Wilms’ tumor confirmed; ophthalmology follow-up (periodic screening)

====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Due for another retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening examination
DURATION: 11-week-old
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 11-week-old former 24-week estimated gestational age premature girl, birth weight 650 g, here for routine ROP screening. One week prior had immature retina in zone I without plus disease. Since that exam she developed sepsis and respiratory compromise requiring IV antibiotics and re‑intubation/ventilatory support; currently intubated on 50% oxygen. History notable for anemia of prematurity and an episode of necrotizing enterocolitis 4 weeks ago. Blinks to light; current fundus exam shows dilation and tortuosity of posterior pole vessels (plus disease) in zone I.
History Narrative: An 11-week-old, former 24-week estimated gestational age premature girl presented for consultation for retinopathy of prematurity screening. Her last examination one week prior demonstrated immature retina in zone 1 with no plus disease. Since that exam she developed sepsis and respiratory compromise requiring intravenous antibiotics and re‑intubation/ventilatory support. She was born weighing 650 g, has anemia of prematurity, and had an episode of necrotizing enterocolitis 4 weeks earlier. On examination she appeared frail and was intubated, receiving 50% oxygen, and blinked briskly to light in either eye. Fundus exam showed dilation and tortuosity of the posterior pole retinal vessels consistent with plus disease in zone 1.
Symptom Onset: 1 week ago
Symptom Duration: 1 week
Progression: Progression to Type I ROP with plus disease in zone I (rapid/aggressive posterior progression)
Characteristics: Vasoproliferative disorder of the retina in premature infants causing avascular peripheral retina, retinal ischemia, neovascularization, and potential progression from mild/self-limited disease to stages with extraretinal proliferation and retinal detachment; posterior pole plus disease features include marked venous dilation and arteriolar tortuosity.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 11-week-old former 24-week EGA female with birth weight 650 g. Prior exam 1 week ago showed immature retina in zone I without plus disease. Now intubated, on 50% oxygen, with new sepsis and respiratory compromise. Fundus exam demonstrates marked dilation and tortuosity of posterior pole vessels consistent with plus disease in zone I. Findings meet criteria for Type I ROP (zone I disease with plus). Bilateral involvement. Recommendation: urgent treatment (e.g., intravitreal anti-VEGF or peripheral retinal ablation) and close follow-up per ROP treatment protocols. Continuous monitoring until disease regression and extended surveillance to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age if anti-VEGF used.
Primary Diagnosis: Type I retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bilateral
Secondary Diagnoses: Retinopathy of prematurity (Type I) ; Premature birth (24-week gestational age) ; Extremely low birth weight (650 g) ; Sepsis ; Respiratory compromise/respiratory failure requiring re-intubation and ventilatory support ; Anemia of prematurity ; Necrotizing enterocolitis (history)
Differential Diagnosis: Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy; Eales’ disease; Norrie’s disease
Severity: Type I (severe)
Laterality: Both eyes
Complications: anemia of prematurity; necrotizing enterocolitis; sepsis; respiratory compromise requiring re-intubation/ventilatory support; potential retinal detachment; cataract; subretinal, intraretinal, and vitreous hemorrhage; severe myopia; amblyopia; strabismus; severe refractive error (myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia)


Plan
All Medications: intravenous antibiotics; supplemental oxygen; intravitreal bevacizumab
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequent retinal examinations until disease regression; for infants treated with bevacizumab, continuous screening up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age to monitor for late reactivation.
Patient Education: Your baby was born very prematurely and is at risk for a condition called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), in which the blood vessels in the retina grow abnormally. Current exam shows Type I ROP (zone I with “plus” disease), which requires prompt treatment to reduce the risk of retinal detachment and vision loss. Two main effective treatments are laser photocoagulation (ablation of the peripheral avascular retina) and intravitreal anti‑VEGF injection (e.g., bevacizumab). Anti‑VEGF injections often allow better peripheral retinal preservation but require longer, careful follow‑up because the disease can reactivate weeks to months later. After treatment your infant will need frequent eye exams until the retina is fully mature (often up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age if treated with anti‑VEGF). Premature infants also have higher risks of amblyopia, strabismus, and significant refractive errors; long‑term ophthalmology follow‑up (including refraction and vision development monitoring) is important. Notify the ophthalmologist promptly for any changes in systemic health (infections, need for increased oxygen/ventilation) because these can worsen ROP.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Infantile esotropia status post strabismus surgery, now with recurrent intermittent esotropia (8Δ at distance with glasses, up to 20Δ in downgaze and at near), left dissociated vertical deviation, bilateral moderate inferior oblique overaction with V‑pattern, asymmetric OKN consistent with early‑onset esotropia, and left‑eye amblyopia (VA 20/30 OD, 20/50 OS). Full cycloplegic hyperopic refractive error (+3.00 D OD, +3.75 D OS) undercorrected in current glasses. Plan: prescribe full cycloplegic correction, monitor alignment and vision; consider bifocals if residual near deviation with documented fusion/stereopsis; if >10–12Δ residual at distance with full correction, consider strabismus surgery.
Primary Diagnosis: Infantile esotropia status post strabismus surgery, with recurrent esotropia, left dissociated vertical deviation, bilateral inferior oblique overaction, and left amblyopia
Secondary Diagnoses: dissociated vertical deviation; bilateral inferior oblique overaction; amblyopia of the left eye
Differential Diagnosis: Infantile esotropia; Accommodative esotropia (refractive or high AC/A); Sixth nerve palsy (congenital or acquired); Duane syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: bilateral
Complications: Amblyopia; dissociated vertical deviation; inferior oblique overaction; V‑pattern strabismus; recurrent/esotropia after prior surgery; reduced stereopsis (poor binocular vision)


Plan
All Medications: cyclopentolate, homatropine, scopolamine, atropine
All Procedures: strabismus surgery (prior at 8 months); cycloplegic refraction (cycloplegic exam) with prescription of full hyperopic spectacle correction; stereopsis testing (Titmus stereo fly); cover/cover–uncover and alternate prism and cover testing; OKN testing; version/ductions testing; amblyopia monitoring and occlusion therapy consideration; possible bifocal prescription if indicated; strabismus surgical options: bilateral medial rectus recession, medial rectus recession with ipsilateral lateral rectus resection, or bilateral lateral rectus resection; neuroimaging (indicated if incomitant/atypical)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in a few months after prescribing new spectacles with full cycloplegic refraction to recheck ocular alignment and vision; monitor for reduction of deviation (suggesting accommodative component), assess stereopsis/fusion, and treat amblyopia as needed. If orthotropic at distance but esotropic at near and fusion present, consider bifocals. If deviation remains >10–12 PD at distance in full spectacles, consider strabismus surgery. Continue regular follow-up throughout childhood to monitor for recurrent amblyopia or esotropia; interval based on stability of angle, visual acuity, and age.
Patient Education: This is infantile esotropia (crossed eye) that was treated with early surgery but has partially returned. Your child has farsightedness (hyperopia) that is undercorrected in her current glasses and mild amblyopia (weaker vision) in the left eye. The first step is to update her glasses to the full cycloplegic prescription (+3.00 OD, +3.75 OS). With the new glasses we will recheck her alignment in a few months; improvement would mean a refractive (accommodative) component. If she becomes straight at distance but still turns in at near, bifocals may be considered if she has measurable fusion/stereopsis. If a residual misalignment >10–12 prism diopters persists with full correction, strabismus surgery may be recommended (options depend on prior surgery and current measurements). Continue close follow-up for vision (amblyopia) monitoring and treatment as needed, because vision and alignment can change during childhood. If you notice sudden changes, one-sided limitation of eye movement, or other neurologic symptoms, contact us promptly.

Follow-Up Instructions: If managed medically: follow up in 2–6 months for reevaluation. If surgery performed: routine healing over ~6 weeks with postoperative follow-up, then long-term surveillance for recurrence, stereopsis decline, and amblyopia.
Patient Education: Intermittent exotropia is a common childhood condition where one eye occasionally drifts outward, often when tired or looking into the distance. It results from a weakness of the brain’s ability to maintain fusion, not from a muscle problem, and usually does not mean serious disease. Key points: - Your child’s vision is good in both eyes and stereopsis (depth perception) is normal now, but intermittent exotropia is lifelong and can fluctuate. - Treatment goals are to improve control and prevent amblyopia (lazy eye), not to “cure” the underlying fusion problem. - Non‑surgical options include observation, part‑time patching (1–2 hours daily) to reduce suppression, overminus spectacles temporarily to stimulate convergence, and—when age/ability allow—convergence exercises (e.g., pencil pushups). These may improve control but rarely eliminate the deviation. - Surgery (usually muscle recession or recession/resection) is considered if control worsens (deviation present much of the day or >40–50% of the time) or for cosmetic/function reasons; most surgeons wait until about age 4 if control is acceptable. - Regular follow‑up is important (every 2–6 months with nonsurgical management; long‑term after surgery) to monitor alignment, stereopsis, and for development of amblyopia, since recurrence after surgery is possible. - Signs to report promptly: increased frequency or duration of the eye turn, decreased vision in either eye, loss of depth perception, or new double vision. If you’d like, we can go over how to perform patching or pencil‑pushup exercises and set up a follow‑up schedule.


CASE 83 — Childhood Ptosis
==========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: droopy right upper lid
DURATION: Since birth
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "lazy"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 17-month-old boy with a droopy right upper lid present since birth; parents note he holds his chin up (~15°), occasionally lets the lid block his pupil, no ocular motility disturbance, no family history of ptosis/strabismus/muscular disorders, otherwise healthy and developing normally.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid with anomalous 15° chin-up head posture. Moderate–severe right upper lid ptosis with interpalpebral fissure 6.5 mm OD vs 10 mm OS, MRD1 0.5 mm OD and 3.5 mm OS (improving to 2 mm OD with chin-up), levator function 6 mm OD and 12 mm OS, absent right lid crease, full motility, pupils equal and reactive without anisocoria or RAPD, cycloplegic refraction minimal anisometropia (−0.25 +1.50 ×90 OD, +0.50 OS), no amblyopia at present. Findings most consistent with congenital levator hypoplasia; surveillance for amblyopia and refractive change and consideration of surgical correction (levator resection vs frontalis suspension depending on levator function and goals) when indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis of the right upper eyelid
Differential Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis; Horner’s syndrome; Third nerve palsy; Marcus Gunn (jaw‑winking) ptosis
Severity: moderate to severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: early and late infection; suture granuloma; exposure keratopathy; retrobulbar hemorrhage; overcorrections


Plan
All Procedures: Occlusion therapy (amblyopia treatment) Pharmacologic or optical penalization (amblyopia treatment) Spectacle correction for anisometropia/astigmatism Fasanella–Servat procedure Levator resection Frontalis suspension (using autogenous fascia lata, banked fascia lata, silicone rod, Supramid/nylon/Prolene/Gore‑Tex sutures, or palmaris longus tendon)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow the child throughout childhood with periodic exams to monitor for amblyopia and anisometropia (surveillance until at least age 7–10 years); after ptosis surgery, monitor lid height and healing over ~1 month, advise nighttime ocular lubrication for the first month (continue long-term if Bell’s phenomenon is absent), and watch for recurrence or postoperative complications.
Patient Education: Congenital right upper‑lid ptosis noted since birth can affect vision if it blocks the pupil. Your child currently has a chin‑up posture to see better; vision is equal in both eyes and there is no amblyopia now. Important points: - Monitor vision and eye alignment regularly because amblyopia or unequal refractive error (anisometropia, often from lid‑induced astigmatism) can develop; prompt treatment (glasses, patching or penalization) is essential if detected. - Surgery is the definitive treatment for significant ptosis to improve vision, visual field, and head posture. Choice of procedure depends on the amount of levator muscle function; options include levator resection or frontalis suspension. Risks include incomplete correction, recurrence, exposure (dry) eye, infection, and rarely more serious complications. - Before any surgery, evaluation will include measurements of lid position, levator function, pupil exam, and refraction. After surgery, expect about a month of healing; temporary nighttime lubrication is often recommended. Long‑term follow‑up is needed through childhood (until at least age 7–10) to watch for amblyopia recurrence and lid position changes. - Seek immediate care if you notice new pupil size difference, eyelid position change, drooping of the other eye, abnormal eye movements, breathing or feeding difficulty, or signs of infection after surgery.


CASE 84 — The Apparently Blind Infant

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Isolated delayed visual maturation (DVM): 3-month-old developmentally and neurologically normal female with poor fixation and following but blinking to bright light, equivocal OKN, normal anterior segment and fundus exams, no nystagmus or afferent pupillary defect. Findings and normal developmental exam favor isolated DVM with favorable prognosis; expect visual maturation by 6–8 months. Recommend pediatric neurological/developmental surveillance and follow-up ophthalmic evaluation; proceed with VEP if vision fails to improve or earlier if concerns arise.
Primary Diagnosis: Isolated delayed visual maturation
Secondary Diagnoses: Delayed visual maturation (isolated)
Differential Diagnosis: Delayed visual maturation; Cortical visual impairment; Bilateral ocular structural abnormalities (e.g., congenital cataract, optic nerve hypoplasia)
Severity: Moderate — severe (functional blindness)
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Procedures: exam under anesthesia; funduscopy; refraction; corneal diameter measurement; measurement of intraocular pressure; optokinetic nystagmus testing; oculocephalic testing; pupillary examination; visual evoked potential (VEP) testing; electroencephalogram (EEG); electroretinogram (ERG); neuroimaging
Follow-Up Instructions: Periodic developmental and neurologic assessments by the pediatrician; expect improvement by 6–8 months; if vision fails to improve by 6–8 months, obtain electrophysiologic testing (VEP/ERG) and neuroimaging and refer to neurology/ophthalmology as indicated.
Patient Education: Delayed visual maturation (DVM) means your infant’s visual system is maturing more slowly than usual but is likely to improve. Key points: - Most infants with isolated DVM develop normal vision by 6–8 months of age. - Because your child’s development and neurologic exam are normal and the eyes and retina appear normal, no immediate invasive testing or surgery is needed. - Watch closely: track visual behaviors (fixation, following faces and toys) and keep routine pediatric visits. - If vision does not clearly improve by 6–8 months, further testing (VEP, ERG, possible neuroimaging) will be recommended to look for other causes. - Maintain good visual stimulation at home: face-to-face interaction, high-contrast toys, bright lights and movement to encourage tracking. - Stay in close communication with your pediatrician and ophthalmologist; report any new neurologic signs, developmental delay, or lack of visual progress.
Referrals: Pediatrician for ongoing developmental and neurologic assessment; neurologist if neurologic abnormalities suspected or for further evaluation; neuroimaging/electrophysiology referral (VEP/EEG) if vision fails to improve by 6–8 months.


CASE 85 — Optic Nerve Hypoplasia
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision in the right eye and esotropia noticed by ophthalmologist
DURATION: 6 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 3-year-old boy referred for poor vision and esotropia. Diagnosed at age 2 with right-eye esotropia and amblyopia; treated with sporadic full-time patching of the left eye for ~6 months without improvement. Parents report weight and height at 15th percentile; otherwise unremarkable medical history and review of systems negative. Referred after no visual improvement and concern for afferent defect.
History Narrative: A 3-year-old boy referred by another ophthalmologist after being diagnosed with esotropia and amblyopia in the right eye at age 2.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Septo-optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia resulting in right>left visual loss (OD 20/200, OS 20/30), manifest esotropia ~25 PD, and a 1+ RAPD OD. Associated pituitary dysfunction with growth hormone deficiency causing short stature and low weight; MRI shows absence of the septum pellucidum. Recommend endocrine evaluation and pituitary hormone replacement as indicated, close growth/endocrine follow-up, trial of amblyopia therapy for potential functional component in the right eye, defer elective strabismus surgery until amblyopia therapy maximized, and provide protective polycarbonate eyewear for the better-seeing eye.
Primary Diagnosis: Septo-optic dysplasia with bilateral asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia
Secondary Diagnoses: Septo-optic dysplasia; Optic nerve hypoplasia (bilateral, asymmetric); Growth hormone deficiency; Short stature; Esotropia; Amblyopia; Relative afferent pupillary defect (right)
Differential Diagnosis: Optic nerve hypoplasia (septo‑optic dysplasia) with pituitary hormone deficiency; Amblyopia (functional) secondary to strabismus; Optic atrophy/optic neuritis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Septo‑optic dysplasia with bilateral asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia leading to visual loss (amblyopia, poor vision in one eye), strabismus (esotropia), potential endocrine abnormalities including growth hormone deficiency and corticotrophin deficiency (risk of adrenal insufficiency/sudden death during illness), midline CNS defects (absence of septum pellucidum/corpus callosum), and increased risk of recurrent strabismus after surgery.


Plan
All Medications: corticosteroids (stress-dose as indicated), growth hormone replacement therapy, botulinum toxin (for strabismus), patching (occlusion therapy)
All Procedures: Full-time patching of the left eye (amblyopia therapy, sporadic use for ~6 months)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Ongoing evaluation of growth and endocrine parameters throughout early childhood with endocrinologist/pediatrician (monitor for delayed-onset deficiencies) - Close follow-up of growth hormone and adrenal (corticotrophin) function; urgent endocrine testing and pituitary hormone replacement as needed - Administer stress doses of corticosteroids during acute illness, surgery, or serious injury if corticotrophin deficiency present - Trial and maximization of amblyopia therapy before strabismus surgery; defer surgery until amblyopia treatment optimized and consider delaying until school age - Prescribe polycarbonate safety spectacles to protect the better-seeing eye
Patient Education: - Optic nerve hypoplasia means one or both optic nerves are underdeveloped and can cause reduced vision; vision can range from near normal to very poor. - Your child’s condition is part of septo‑optic dysplasia, which can be associated with midline brain differences and pituitary (hormone) problems. - Hormone testing and ongoing endocrine follow‑up are essential (growth hormone and adrenal/corticotrophin deficiencies are most important); an endocrinologist should coordinate care. - Neuroimaging (MRI) is used to look for brain and pituitary abnormalities and may guide monitoring. - A trial of amblyopia therapy (patching, glasses) is appropriate because some vision improvement may be possible despite the optic nerve abnormality. - Strabismus surgery can be considered later, but is usually deferred until amblyopia treatment is maximized and often until school age; recurrence is more likely when vision is poor. - Protect the better‑seeing eye (polycarbonate safety glasses) to prevent loss of the remaining useful vision. - If a pituitary/adrenal deficiency is present, give stress‑dose steroids during serious illness, surgery, or injury — discuss an emergency plan with your endocrinologist/pediatrician.
Referrals: Endocrinology (urgent)
Emergency Instructions: Administer stress doses of corticosteroids during acute illness, surgery, or serious injury if corticotrophin deficiency is present; ensure endocrinologist/pediatrician follow-up for urgent evaluation and pituitary hormone replacement as needed.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Ptosis of both upper eyelids due to levator aponeurosis disinsertion (aponeurotic ptosis), worse on the right; bilateral good levator function (14 mm), absent/effaced upper lid creases and deep superior sulci consistent with age-related aponeurotic dehiscence. No evidence of neurogenic, myogenic, or mechanical cause on exam; vision 20/20 OU but symptomatic visual field impairment from ptosis.
Primary Diagnosis: Ptosis of both upper eyelids due to levator aponeurosis disinsertion
Differential Diagnosis: Aponeurotic (levator aponeurosis dehiscence) ptosis; Neurogenic ptosis (eg, Horner’s syndrome or CN III palsy, myasthenia gravis); Myogenic ptosis (congenital levator deficiency or systemic myopathy); Mechanical ptosis (eyelid mass or severe blepharochalasis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: undercorrection or overcorrection, asymmetric or unsatisfactory lid contour, lagophthalmos with exposure symptoms


Plan
All Procedures: bilateral cataract extraction with placement of intraocular lenses; external levator advancement (bilateral)
Patient Education: Your drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) are most likely caused by age-related weakening and detachment of the levator aponeurosis, the tendon that lifts the eyelid. This condition can slowly worsen and, as in your case, interfere with your upper visual field. What this means for you: - The good levator muscle function indicates the problem is a mechanical detachment (aponeurotic ptosis), not a nerve or muscle disease. - Non-surgical measures such as taping the eyelid or an eyelid crutch on glasses can help temporarily but typically do not provide a lasting solution. Treatment and expectations: - Surgical repair (levator advancement/reattachment) reestablishes the eyelid crease and improves lid height and vision. It can be done through an external incision with local anesthesia; your surgeon can adjust the lid position during the procedure for symmetry. - Possible complications include under- or overcorrection, asymmetry, contour changes, or incomplete eyelid closure leading to dry eye symptoms. These are uncommon and usually manageable. Aftercare: - You may experience improved vision soon after surgery. Follow postoperative instructions for wound care, avoid heavy lifting and rubbing the eyes, and use prescribed drops or ointment if given. - Report excessive pain, worsening vision, increasing redness, or signs of infection promptly. - A follow-up visit will assess healing, lid height, and any need for further adjustment. If you notice fluctuating droop, muscle weakness, double vision, or pupil changes, notify your physician as additional neurologic or neuromuscular testing may be needed.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Thyroid eye disease (Graves’ orbitopathy) — bilateral with eyelid retraction and mild bilateral proptosis. Clinical features: 18-month history of progressive bilateral eye prominence, ocular surface irritation and gritty sensation, dull periocular pain worsened by eye movement, 2 mm bilateral lagophthalmos, upper and lower eyelid retraction (palpebral fissures 16 mm OD, 15 mm OS), mild (–1) restriction of upgaze OU, increased resistance to retropulsion, corneal punctate epithelial erosions inferiorly, mild bulbar conjunctival injection, IOP 21 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS, BCVA 20/20 OU, normal color vision, no RAPD, optic discs flat without pallor, Humphrey visual fields normal. CT orbit: mild–moderate enlargement of both inferior rectus muscles and left medial rectus with tendon-sparing changes; no apical optic nerve compression. Systemic: endocrinology evaluation revealed hypothyroidism on thyroid hormone replacement. Management: initial conservative therapy with frequent artificial tears and punctal occlusion for exposure; after 4 months of stable symptoms, surgical recession of all four eyelids with good cosmetic and symptomatic outcome. Plan: continue thyroid management and ocular surface lubrication; monitor for progression of motility or signs of compressive optic neuropathy; consider orbital decompression or strabismus surgery only if indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Thyroid eye disease (Graves’ orbitopathy)
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypothyroidism
Differential Diagnosis: Thyroid eye disease (Graves’ orbitopathy); Idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital myositis); Orbital metastasis; Orbital infiltrative disease (sarcoidosis/amyloidosis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: corneal exposure (punctate epithelial erosions), lagophthalmos, elevated intraocular pressure, risk of restrictive strabismus and potential optic neuropathy


Plan
All Medications: artificial tears; lubricating ointment at bedtime; punctal occlusion (procedure); prednisone (oral corticosteroid, 80–100 mg daily) — note: patient maintained on thyroid hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine)
All Procedures: frequent artificial tears; punctal occlusion; recession of all four eyelids (upper and lower eyelid recession bilaterally)
Follow-Up Instructions: Continue artificial tears and lubricating ointment at bedtime; use moisture shield at night as needed. Maintain punctal occlusion. Monitor symptoms and vision; return for follow-up if worsening pain, vision loss, increased diplopia, or increased corneal exposure. Endocrinology follow-up for thyroid hormone replacement and routine endocrinology monitoring. Surgical follow-up after eyelid surgery and routine ophthalmic follow-up to ensure stability.
Patient Education: Thyroid eye disease is caused by inflammation and enlargement of the eye muscles and orbital tissues related to thyroid dysfunction. It can cause eye bulging (proptosis), eyelid retraction, gritty/dry eyes, limited eye movement, and in severe cases optic nerve compression. Management depends on severity: for mild exposure symptoms use frequent artificial tears, lubricating ointment at bedtime, moisture shields at night, and consider punctal occlusion; control elevated eye pressure with topical drops if needed. Active inflammation or optic nerve involvement may require high‑dose corticosteroids, orbital radiation, or orbital decompression surgery. Strabismus surgery is considered for stable, symptomatic double vision (wait 3–4 months of stability and after any decompression). Eyelid surgery is performed after orbit and muscle procedures to correct retraction. Coordinate care with an endocrinologist for thyroid testing and treatment; disease course of the eyes can be independent of thyroid status. Seek urgent care for worsening vision, new color loss, increasing double vision, or severe pain.
Referrals: Endocrinology evaluation

Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: epiphora, conjunctival hypertrophy, keratinization of exposed tarsal conjunctiva, superficial punctate keratitis, ocular irritation


Plan
All Procedures: lateral tarsal strip procedure; medial spindle procedure
Patient Education: Lubricating eye drops during the day and an ocular ointment at night to relieve dryness and irritation; avoid rubbing the eye. If symptoms worsen or don’t improve, surgical repair (commonly a lateral tarsal strip ± medial spindle for involutional ectropion) is the definitive treatment. Expect improved symptoms after surgery; report increasing pain, vision changes, excessive redness, or wound problems promptly. Follow-up as scheduled for postoperative checks.


CASE 89 — Entropion
===================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Severe right eye pain for 2 years, relieved by manually retracting the right lower eyelid.
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I can alleviate my pain if I manually retract my right lower eyelid."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 75-year-old woman with a 2‑year history of progressively worsening severe right eye pain; she discovered that manually retracting her right lower eyelid alleviates the pain. On exam the right lower eyelid is turned inward with lashes rubbing the globe; moderate horizontal lid laxity is present and the lid can be restored with gentle downward traction but reverts with blinking.
History Narrative: A 75-year-old woman presented with complaints of severe right eye pain that has been progressively worsening for 2 years. The patient has discovered that she can alleviate her pain if she manually retracts her right lower eyelid. Examination shows “in-turning” of the right lower eyelid causing the lashes to rub against the epibulbar surface. Moderate horizontal laxity of the lower lid is present. With gentle downward traction on the right lower eyelid, the lid margin can be restored to its normal position; however, the in-turning recurs when the patient blinks.
Symptom Onset: 2 years
Symptom Duration: 2 years
Progression: Progressively worsening for 2 years
Characteristics: In-turning of the right lower eyelid with lashes rubbing on the epibulbar surface; moderate horizontal lower lid laxity; overriding of the preseptal orbicularis; reducible with downward traction (digital eversion test positive); involutional etiology.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Blinking
Alleviating Factors: Manually retracting her right lower eyelid
Associated Symptoms: Severe right eye pain, ocular irritation (from lashes rubbing the epibulbar surface), relief with manual retraction of the right lower eyelid
Prior Treatments: Taping the lid; lubricating drops and ointment; temporizing everting (Quickert–Rathbun) sutures; Wies procedure (definitive surgery)
Impact on Daily Activities: Severe right eye pain for 2 years causing manual retraction of the lower eyelid for relief; significant ocular irritation from lashes rubbing — markedly impaired comfort and likely interference with daily activities (moderate-to-severe impact).
Risk Factors: Age-related changes (advanced age), horizontal eyelid laxity, disinsertion/dehiscence of lower eyelid retractors, overriding preseptal orbicularis muscle, orbital soft-tissue atrophy/relative enophthalmos; trauma, prior ocular surgery/edema (can cause spastic entropion), cicatricial disease (Stevens–Johnson syndrome, cicatricial pemphigoid), chemical/thermal burns.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 89-year-old woman with involutional entropion of the right lower eyelid causing lashes to rub on the ocular surface with progressive 2-year history of severe right eye pain relieved by manual eversion. Exam shows moderate horizontal laxity and lower lid retractor dysfunction with overriding preseptal orbicularis; lid can be temporarily everted with downward traction (positive digital eversion), lid not restricted — consistent with involutional (age-related) entropion rather than cicatricial or spastic causes. Treatment options discussed include lubricants, taping, temporizing Quickert-Rathbun everting sutures, and definitive surgical repair (lateral tarsal strip, Wies procedure, or retractor reinsertion). Patient underwent a Wies procedure of the right lower eyelid with satisfactory correction and no postoperative complications.
Primary Diagnosis: Involutional entropion of the right lower eyelid
Differential Diagnosis: Involutional entropion; Spastic entropion (from ocular irritation/lid edema); Cicatricial entropion (eg, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, mucous membrane pemphigoid, posttraumatic scarring)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: None


Plan
All Medications: lubricating drops; ointment
All Procedures: Wies procedure of the right lower eyelid
Patient Education: Entropion is when the lower eyelid turns inward so lashes rub the eye, causing pain and irritation. In your case this is age‑related (involutional) from looseness of the eyelid and downward retractor changes. Short‑term measures include lubricating eye drops and ointment, taping the lid, or placing temporary everting (Quickert‑Rathbun) sutures to relieve symptoms. Definitive surgical options aim to tighten the eyelid and/or reattach the lower‑lid retractors — common procedures are lateral tarsal strip, Wies procedure, or direct retractor repair; the Wies procedure was performed for you with good correction. After surgery, keep the eye lubricated, avoid rubbing, follow wound‑care instructions, attend follow‑up visits to check healing, and report increasing pain, vision change, redness, or discharge promptly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 64-year-old woman with chronic left-eye irritation from lower lid entropion and aberrant posterior lashes (distichiasis) causing trichiasis with mild inferior punctate corneal staining and rose bengal staining of the inferior bulbar conjunctiva. Examination also notable for diffuse lid margin thickening, telangiectasia, collarettes and signs of blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction of all four lids. Impression: trichiasis of the left lower eyelid due to distichiasis and entropion, with coexisting blepharitis/MGD contributing to ocular surface irritation.
Primary Diagnosis: Trichiasis of the lower eyelid due to aberrant lashes (distichiasis) and lower lid entropion
Secondary Diagnoses: Blepharitis; Meibomian gland dysfunction; Distichiasis; Lower eyelid entropion
Differential Diagnosis: Lower lid entropion with trichiasis due to distichiasis; Meibomian gland dysfunction/blepharitis causing metaplastic lashes; Ocular surface disease with dry eye (Sjögren syndrome)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left
Complications: loss of skin pigmentation and eyelid notching


Plan
All Medications: lubricating drops and ointment
All Procedures: Wies procedure; cryotherapy to aberrant lashes; office cryotherapy retreatment; lid hygiene program (blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction care)
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative follow-up with monitoring for lash recurrence and retreatment as needed (cryotherapy in office for focal recurrence); continue lid hygiene program for blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction and use lubricating drops/ointment until surgery as needed.
Patient Education: - Keep eyelids clean with a daily lid hygiene program: warm compresses for 5–10 minutes followed by gentle scrubbing of the lid margins with diluted baby shampoo or a commercial lid scrub to reduce debris and meibomian gland dysfunction. - Use preservative‑free artificial tears frequently during the day and an ointment at bedtime to protect the ocular surface and relieve irritation. - Avoid rubbing the eye; if an irritating lash is present, do not repeatedly pull it out yourself—seek clinic treatment (epilation, cryotherapy, or surgical options). - Expect that epilation often provides only temporary relief and that recurrence is common; cryotherapy or surgical correction (entropion repair, wedge excision, or lid splitting with follicle removal) may be recommended for longer‑term control. - Report increasing pain, vision changes, or signs of infection (redness, swelling, discharge) promptly. - Continue follow‑up visits for monitoring and retreatment as needed; attend appointments after entropion repair and any lash treatments.


CASE 91 — Dacryocystitis
========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Tearing and pain of the right lower eyelid medially
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "constant epiphora of the right eye since the time of her surgeries" "intermittent redness of the right lower eyelid, associated with tenderness and mucous discharge from the eye"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 44-year-old woman with a history of prior extensive midfacial surgery (removal of nasal septum and frontoethmoidectomies) presenting with chronic constant right-sided epiphora since those surgeries, and more recently intermittent redness, tenderness, mucous discharge, and pain over the right medial lower eyelid. Previously treated with topical antibiotic drops. Examination showed medial right lower lid erythema and tenderness, mucoid discharge expressed from the punctum, mildly injected conjunctiva, patent upper and lower puncta, and nasolacrimal irrigation demonstrated distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction; nasal exam revealed a large septal defect.
History Narrative: A 44-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of tearing and pain of the right lower eyelid medially. Her past medical history was significant for lethal midline granuloma (midfacial necrotizing lesion) for which she had undergone multiple procedures, including removal of the nasal septum and frontoethmoidectomies. She reported constant epiphora of the right eye since the time of her surgeries and had more recently noted intermittent redness of the right lower eyelid, associated with tenderness and mucous discharge from the eye. She had been previously treated with an unknown ophthalmic antibiotic drop. Examination showed erythema of the right lower lid medially with associated tenderness to palpation. No definite masses were palpated in the lacrimal sac region. There was a whitish mucoid discharge expressed from the punctum upon palpation of the lacrimal sac, and the conjunctiva was mildly injected. The puncta of the right upper and lower eyelid were present and appeared patent. There was a well-healed surgical incision over the nose with residual distortion of the nasal architecture. The remainder of the ophthalmic examination was completely normal. Nasolacrimal irrigation was performed and demonstrated complete obstruction of the distal nasal lacrimal system. The upper system was patent as demonstrated by the reflux of irrigating solution through the upper and lower puncta. Inspection of the inner nose showed a large nasal defect with an absent septum.
Symptom Onset: Since the time of her surgeries
Symptom Duration: Since the time of her surgeries (chronic; longstanding)

CHIEF COMPLAINT: right-sided eyelid swelling, pain, and fever
DURATION: 4 days
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "No definite complaint of decreased vision"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 7-year-old boy with 4 days of right-sided eyelid swelling, pain, and fever. Initially treated as preseptal cellulitis with oral antibiotics, but over 2 days had progression with increased right upper lid edema leading to complete ptosis. On presentation he was lethargic, complained of right eye pain, temperature 100°F, marked periorbital edema and erythema, conjunctival injection, decreased right globe motility in all directions, mild proptosis; no definite complaint of decreased vision and vision tested 20/25 OD, 20/20 OS. Prior oral antibiotics failed to prevent progression.
History Narrative: A 7-year-old boy was referred for evaluation and treatment of right-sided eyelid swelling, pain, and fever that began 4 days earlier. He had no definite complaint of decreased vision. He was initially diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and started on oral antibiotics. Two days later his right upper lid edema progressed to complete ptosis despite antibiotics, prompting referral to a tertiary care center. On arrival he was somewhat lethargic and continued to complain of pain around the right eye; temperature was 100 °F. Exam showed marked periorbital edema and erythema with complete eyelid ptosis, enlarged preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes, diffuse conjunctival injection, decreased motility of the right globe in all directions, mild proptosis (formal measurement precluded by edema), no conjunctival discharge, normal pupillary reactions without relative afferent pupillary defect, quiet anterior segments, and a dilated fundus exam without significant abnormalities.

Treated with IV antibiotics and surgical drainage with ethmoidectomy; cultures negative. Clinical improvement with resolution of swelling and motility deficit.
Primary Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis with subperiosteal (superomedial) orbital abscess and associated ethmoid sinusitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Sinusitis (ethmoid sinusitis), subperiosteal orbital abscess, preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy, fever, lethargy
Differential Diagnosis: Preseptal cellulitis; Idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital pseudotumor); Leukemic orbital infiltration / extraocular extension of neoplasm
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: orbital apex syndrome; blindness; brain abscess; cavernous sinus thrombosis; death


Plan
All Medications: oral antibiotics intravenous ceftriaxone clindamycin oxacillin

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 12-year-old boy with a 1-week history of left upper eyelid swelling. Exam notable for redness, fullness of the temporal left upper lid producing an "S-shaped" deformity, enlargement and erythema of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, marked lateral bulbar conjunctival injection and chemosis, moderate tenderness over the enlarged lacrimal gland, and mild regional lymphadenopathy. Ocular motility and remainder of eye exam normal; no intraocular inflammation or orbital signs. Serology positive for EBV viral capsid antigen antibodies and negative for EBV nuclear antigen antibodies, consistent with recent Epstein–Barr virus infection. Impression: acute dacryoadenitis of the left eye secondary to recent EBV infection.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute dacryoadenitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Epstein–Barr virus (recent infection)
Differential Diagnosis: Acute infectious dacryoadenitis (viral—EBV, mumps; bacterial—Staph/Strep/Gonococcus); Idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital pseudotumor involving lacrimal gland); Lacrimal gland neoplasm (primary epithelial/nonepithelial or metastatic)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: topical corticosteroid (trial), oral corticosteroid (trial), supportive/self-limited care
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for resolution of symptoms.
Patient Education: Acute dacryoadenitis is inflammation of the lacrimal (tear) gland that commonly causes pain, swelling, and fullness of the outer upper eyelid and tearing. In your child’s case the most likely cause is a recent Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. Typical points to know and follow: - What to expect: symptoms often improve over days to weeks and the condition is usually self‑limited. Swelling, redness, and tenderness should gradually lessen. - Symptom care: apply warm compresses to the affected eyelid several times daily for comfort; over‑the‑counter pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen, dosed by age/weight) can help with pain and fever. - Medications: if the clinician prescribes topical or oral corticosteroids for inflammation, give exactly as directed and complete the course; if antibiotics are given (only if bacterial infection suspected), take the full course. - Signs to seek care promptly: increasing pain, spreading redness, fever not controlled by medication, new vision changes, decreased eye movement or eye protrusion, increasing swelling, or purulent discharge—these may indicate bacterial infection or orbital involvement. - Follow‑up: attend scheduled follow‑up to ensure resolution; imaging (CT/MRI) or further testing may be done if symptoms worsen or fail to resolve to rule out other causes such as tumor or idiopathic orbital inflammation. - Prevention and contagion: EBV is spread by saliva; practice good hand hygiene and avoid sharing utensils during acute illness. Most cases in children are viral and recover without long‑term problems. If you have questions about medications, dosing, or new symptoms, contact the ophthalmology clinic or your pediatrician.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 8-month-old boy with a congenital, slowly enlarging, moderately firm, well-circumscribed superotemporal right orbital mass fixed to underlying tissues, intact overlying skin, no proptosis or rim defect — clinical presentation and location most consistent with a dermoid cyst of the right orbit.
Primary Diagnosis: Dermoid cyst of the right orbit
Differential Diagnosis: Dermoid/epidermoid cyst; Capillary hemangioma; Lymphangioma; Rhabdomyosarcoma
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Procedures: Excision of right superotemporal orbital dermoid cyst via lid crease incision (complete surgical excision)
Follow-Up Instructions: Routine postoperative follow-up with ophthalmology to monitor wound healing and for suture removal; schedule visit within 1 week after surgery and again at ~4–6 weeks to assess for recurrence or complications and ensure normal visual development/amblyopia surveillance.
Patient Education: Dermoid cysts are benign, congenital lumps that commonly occur at the orbital rim. They tend to grow slowly and can cause inflammation if they rupture. Surgical removal is recommended to prevent rupture and for cosmetic reasons. Surgery is typically done through a small eyelid-crease incision to minimize visible scarring; complete excision of the cyst wall is important to prevent recurrence. There is no effective medical therapy. Risks of surgery include bleeding, infection, scarring, and injury to nearby structures, but most infants recover well. Follow-up exams ensure proper healing and normal eye development; return promptly for redness, drainage, increased swelling, fever, or changes in the child’s vision or eye alignment.
Referrals: Ophthalmic surgeon (pediatric oculoplastic/orbital surgeon) for evaluation and surgical excision; Pediatric oncology referral if malignancy suspected (rhabdomyosarcoma) — N/A otherwise.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 44-year-old man with progressive painless left proptosis, 4 mm relative proptosis OS, increased resistance to retropulsion, change in refractive error, CT showing well-circumscribed retrobulbar enhancing mass pressing on posterior globe, consistent with probable cavernous hemangioma of the left orbit; diagnosis confirmed after lateral orbitotomy and histopathology.
Primary Diagnosis: Probable cavernous hemangioma of the left orbit
Differential Diagnosis: Cavernous hemangioma; Hemangiopericytoma; Orbital lymphoma (lymphoproliferative lesion); Lacrimal gland epithelial tumor (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left
Complications: None


Plan
All Procedures: Lateral orbitotomy; surgical excision (removal in toto) of left orbital cavernous hemangioma; histopathologic evaluation of excised tumor
Follow-Up Instructions: Patient did well postoperatively; monitor vision and refractive stability, wound healing, and extraocular motility with follow-up visits (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, and as needed); obtain postoperative ophthalmic exam including visual acuity, refraction, slit-lamp and dilated fundus exam to document resolution of choroidal striae; monitor for recurrence clinically and with imaging only if symptoms recur.
Patient Education: You have a benign vascular tumor of the orbit called a cavernous hemangioma. It commonly causes painless, progressive bulging (proptosis) and can change your eyeglass prescription. Imaging (CT/MRI) is used to evaluate size and location. Because these tumors are usually well‑circumscribed and encapsulated, surgical removal (orbitotomy) can often cure the problem when symptoms progress, as in your case; recurrence is uncommon when the tumor is removed completely. There is no effective medical (drug) treatment. After surgery you should have periodic eye exams to monitor vision, eye position, and for any signs of recurrence; report new pain, rapid swelling, vision loss, or double vision promptly. If you have history or risk factors for systemic cancer, additional evaluation may be recommended, but for isolated cavernous hemangioma no systemic workup is usually needed.

Ophthalmic exam was otherwise within normal limits except for a large elevated nonpigmented nodule measuring ~15 × 12 × 7 mm with numerous small telangiectatic surface vessels, thickened pearly edges, no ulceration, freely mobile over underlying tissue, and no regional lymphadenopathy. The facial skin showed diffuse sun-exposure changes with fine wrinkles, telangiectasias, and scattered crusting.
Symptom Onset: Approximately 8 months prior to presentation
Symptom Duration: 8 months
Progression: Progressive over ~8 months with fairly rapid growth (enlarging lesion)
Characteristics: Enlarging, nonpigmented, elevated nodular skin lesion with numerous surface telangiectatic vessels, pearly thickened edges, freely mobile overlying skin, no ulceration, rapid growth over ~8 months, occasional bleeding.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 55-year-old man with an 8-month history of an enlarging, nonpigmented, telangiectatic nodule of the right upper eyelid at the medial canthal region. Clinical features—rapid growth, prior focal bleeding, pearly edges, surface telangiectasias, and size approximately 15 × 12 × 7 mm—are highly suggestive of a malignant eyelid tumor, most consistent with nodular basal cell carcinoma. No ulceration, no fixation to deep structures, and no regional lymphadenopathy were noted. Differential includes squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, and cutaneous melanoma; tissue diagnosis is required. Excisional biopsy with intraoperative frozen section was performed, confirming nodular basal cell carcinoma with clear margins. Full-thickness skin graft performed for reconstruction. Plan: no further immediate oncologic therapy required given clear margins; patient educated about increased risk for new skin malignancies and referred for dermatologic surveillance.
Primary Diagnosis: Probable basal cell carcinoma of the right upper eyelid (medial canthal region)
Differential Diagnosis: Basal cell carcinoma; Squamous cell carcinoma; Sebaceous gland carcinoma; Malignant melanoma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: None reported


Plan
All Medications: Imiquimod; 5-fluorouracil; Vismodegib; Sonidegib
All Procedures: Excisional biopsy of right upper eyelid lesion with intraoperative frozen section analysis confirming basal cell carcinoma and full-thickness skin graft repair of the resulting defect.
Follow-Up Instructions: Under care of a dermatologist for continued surveillance and education about increased risk for new skin malignancies.
Patient Education: Educated about his increased risk for development of new skin malignancies and placed under the care of a dermatologist for continued surveillance.
Referrals: Dermatology and oncology (for complete metastatic evaluation if sebaceous carcinoma or melanoma suspected)
