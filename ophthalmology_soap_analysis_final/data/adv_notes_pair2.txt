Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: bilateral itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and crusting eyelids in the morning
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 42-year-old woman with 2-year history of intermittent bilateral ocular itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and morning eyelid crusting, recently worsened; symptoms unrelated to systemic illness or allergies and no ocular medications.
History Narrative: A 42-year-old woman with no past ocular history presents with complaints of bilateral itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and crusting eyelids in the morning. Although she has experienced these symptoms intermittently over the last 2 years, her symptoms have recently become worse. She denies taking any ocular medications. Her symptoms are unrelated to any systemic illness including allergy, rosacea, or flulike symptoms.
Symptom Onset: Over the last 2 years, recently worsened
Symptom Duration: intermittently over the last 2 years
Progression: Worsening over recent period (symptoms recently became worse)
Characteristics: acute, bilateral itching/burning/foreign body sensation, crusting eyelids, mild eyelid margin erythema with scaling, trichiasis/madarosis/poliosis, mild conjunctival hyperemia with inferior papillary reaction, diminished tear lake, inferior superficial punctate epithelial erosions, mild aqueous tear deficiency

Patient Education: Observation and symptomatic care: use cool compresses and unpreserved lubricating drops. The condition may be contagious for 1–2 weeks (or longer); practice strict hygiene—frequent hand washing, keep used tissues, washcloths, and pillowcases separate from others. Return earlier if membranes/pseudomembranes develop (may need removal). Follow-up in 4–6 weeks to confirm improvement; seek sooner care if vision worsens or severe symptoms occur.
Work Restrictions: Avoid work that risks spreading infection; maintain strict personal hygiene (frequent hand washing, avoid sharing tissues/washcloths/pillowcases) and stay off work if contagious until symptoms improve (approximately 1–2 weeks).


CASE 02 — Chronic Follicular Conjunctivitis
===========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Photophobia, right eye discomfort, and headache centered around the right eye for 2 weeks.
DURATION: 2 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I specifically deny any sexual contact."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 37-year-old female with 2 weeks of right eye photophobia, discomfort, and headache; 1 week after symptoms began she developed sudden onset redness and watering of the right eye on returning to work after a Hawaii vacation, with associated swelling in front of the right ear and a mildly tender preauricular node. Treated by prior provider with 2 weeks topical tobramycin–dexamethasone; follicles persisted and 2 days after stopping drops she developed corneal epithelial infiltrates. Visual acuity 20/25 OD, 20/20 OS; unilateral ptosis ~1–2 mm OD, mild bulbar injection, moderate pretarsal follicles and papillae OD, few follicles OS; right corneal midperipheral and some central epithelial infiltrates without stromal involvement. Denies sexual contact and systemic/genital symptoms.
History Narrative: A 37-year-old female office worker with a 2-week history of photophobia, ocular discomfort, and right-sided headache. One week prior she developed sudden onset redness and watering of the right eye on the first day back at work after a vacation in Hawaii. She noted swelling in front of the right ear. She saw her eye-care practitioner, who found unilateral follicular conjunctivitis with a mildly tender preauricular node and treated her with a 2-week course of topical tobramycin–dexamethasone suspension. The node became slightly smaller, but 2 days after stopping the drops she developed epithelial corneal infiltrates and persistent follicles. She denies systemic or genital symptoms and reports no known bird or cat exposure; she stayed in hotel rooms and used swimming pool facilities while traveling. Visual acuity 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. On exam there is a right-sided nontender preauricular node, 1–2 mm right upper lid ptosis, mild bulbar conjunctival injection OD, moderate pretarsal follicles and papillae OD (fewer follicles inferiorly OS), and diffuse midperipheral and a few central corneal epithelial infiltrates OD without stromal involvement; left cornea and anterior segment are normal. Prior topical corticosteroid use likely altered the clinical course. Tests for adenovirus, HSV, and chlamydia were negative. Medication history notable for brimonidine use, which was discontinued as the presumed offending agent. Symptoms and follicles improved rapidly after stopping brimonidine and resolved by 2 months.
Symptom Onset: 2 weeks prior
Symptom Duration: 2 weeks
Progression: Improved after discontinuation of offending agent; follicles resolving by 3 weeks and completely resolved by 2 months.
Characteristics: Unilateral chronic follicular conjunctivitis with moderate pretarsal follicles and papillae, mild bulbar injection, small epithelial corneal infiltrates (midperipheral and some central), 1–2 mm right upper eyelid ptosis (pseudoptosis), and preauricular lymphadenopathy.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Use of topical tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension drops (topical corticosteroid) and continued use of brimonidine (topical glaucoma medication)
Alleviating Factors: Discontinuation of the offending topical agent (brimonidine) and use of preservative-free lubrication/cold compresses
Associated Symptoms: Photophobia, discomfort, headache, redness, watering (tearing), swelling in front of right ear, mild eyelid ptosis, irritation, erythema
Prior Treatments: Topical tobramycin–dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension drops; brimonidine (discontinued)
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild — symptoms (photophobia, discomfort, headache) caused some irritation but vision largely preserved (20/25 OD, 20/20 OS) and improved after stopping brimonidine.
Systemic Symptoms: Denies systemic symptoms
Recent Travel: Hawaii
Risk Factors: Recent use of topical ophthalmic medications (tobramycin–dexamethasone drops and brimonidine), recent swimming pool/hotel exposure (fomite exposure), recent travel (vacation to Hawaii)

========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Routine follow-up 15 months after penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye; mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling.
DURATION: 15 months
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I had 'strep throat' or 'mononucleosis'."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 38-year-old female, 15 months post–right penetrating keratoplasty, with comfortable eyes but 6-week history of right-sided preauricular lymphadenopathy and mild preauricular discomfort/swelling following a febrile illness 6 weeks earlier; denied ocular symptoms during that illness. Currently unilateral right-sided mild lid puffiness, mild lid scurf, prominent inferior and superior tarsal follicles and papillae, mild diffuse keratoplasty epitheliopathy, VA 20/60 improving to 20/40 pinhole OD, IOP 28 mmHg OD, on loteprednol, brimonidine, timolol, and methylcellulose; no other systemic symptoms, otherwise healthy. Treated with oral penicillin for presumed strep/mono at time of febrile illness with resolution of fever but persistent preauricular lymphadenopathy.
History Narrative: A 38-year-old female patient presents for a routine follow-up visit 15 months after penetrating keratoplasty and anterior segment reconstruction for trauma to the right eye. Her eyes are comfortable, but she complains of mild right-sided preauricular discomfort and swelling. She recalls that 6 weeks previously she developed a fever and swollen glands, particularly on the right side of her face, and her internist suspected “strep throat” or “mononucleosis.” She had no ocular symptoms at that time. Throat culture and Epstein–Barr virus serology were taken and were negative. She was treated with oral penicillin for 14 days, and she recovered symptomatically except for the persisting preauricular lymphadenopathy. The patient is otherwise healthy with a negative review of systems. Her past ocular history is also significant for medically treated traumatic angle recession glaucoma of her right eye. Her left eye is normal with no ocular history. Her ocular medications for the right eye were loteprednol etabonate 0.5% twice daily, brimonidine 0.2% twice daily, timolol gel-forming solution 0.5% twice daily, and methylcellulose at bedtime. She had last been seen 3 months previously, and no ocular inflammation was seen. Her current examination reveals a visual acuity of 20/60 + with pinhole to 20/40 in the right eye. Intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg in the right eye and 14 mm Hg in the left eye. She has a slightly tender right preauricular lymph node. External exam reveals slight puffiness of the lids, right worse than left. Biomicroscopy of the right eye shows mild lid scurf and no other lesions. The conjunctiva reveals prominent follicles and papillae in the inferior fornix and superior pretarsal area. No granulomas are present. The keratoplasty has mild diffuse epitheliopathy. The anterior segment exam is otherwise noncontributory. The left eye shows mild pretarsal papillae, without follicles, and an otherwise normal exam. The patient denied using any eye drops other than the prescription medications already listed. She denied close contact with animals, including cats and birds. She had not traveled to potentially endemic areas for other infectious etiologies. She denied any gynecologic complaints and reported being monogamous.
Symptom Onset: Chronic ( >16 days ), with onset ~6 weeks prior (insidious/chronic)
Symptom Duration: 6 weeks
Progression: Acute (hours to days)
Characteristics: Red eye with conjunctival injection, chemosis, purulent/mucopurulent discharge, ocular irritation, eyelids stuck together in morning; may begin unilateral and spread, can include papillary reaction and inflammatory (pseudo)membranes; onset acute (hours–days) or hyperacute (<24 h) in severe cases.

Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right
Complications: Risk of corneal involvement including corneal perforation (particularly in hyperacute/gonococcal cases); transmission to other eye/contacts; rare systemic spread in severe infections; formation of inflammatory membranes or pseudomembranes; potential for decreased vision.


Plan
All Medications: loteprednol etabonate 0.5% (eye drops) brimonidine 0.2% (eye drops) timolol gel-forming solution 0.5% (eye drops) methylcellulose (eye drops) oral penicillin (14 days) trimethoprim sulfate–polymyxin B drops (four times daily for 7 days) azithromycin 1000 mg PO once (as treatment option) doxycycline 100 mg PO twice daily (7–10 days; option) erythromycin 500 mg PO four times daily (7–10 days; option) bacitracin (topical; option) aminoglycosides (topical; option) fluoroquinolones (topical; option) ceftriaxone (intramuscular one-time; for gonococcal) intravenous ceftriaxone (inpatient; if cornea involved) gentamicin (topical; option) ciprofloxacin (topical; option) besifloxacin (topical; option)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up if symptoms worsen or do not improve within 48–72 hours; return sooner for increasing pain, vision loss, marked swelling, or copious purulent discharge; seek immediate care for signs of hyperacute infection (rapid onset, copious purulence) or concern for corneal involvement.
Patient Education: Use prescribed antibiotic eye drops as directed (trimethoprim–polymyxin B four times daily for 7 days). Expect symptom improvement within a few days; most cases resolve within 1–2 weeks. Apply warm compresses and artificial tears for comfort. Avoid touching eyes, sharing towels, or close contact to reduce transmission. Return promptly for worsening symptoms (increasing pain, vision loss, copious purulent discharge, or spreading redness) or if no improvement within 48–72 hours. If hyperacute signs (rapid onset, marked purulence, severe pain) occur, seek immediate care—this may require systemic antibiotics.
Work Restrictions: Avoid touching eyes or sharing towels/washcloths while symptomatic.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate emergency care if you develop severe eye pain, marked vision loss, copious purulent discharge, rapidly worsening redness/swelling, signs of corneal involvement (white spot on the cornea), fever/systemic illness, or if symptoms rapidly worsen despite treatment.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 60-year-old woman with bilateral pterygia, right greater than left, presenting with decreased vision, irritation, and mucopurulent discharge OD. Exam shows injected, edematous right conjunctiva with an inferior fornix pseudomembrane and 2+ papillary reaction of the palpebral conjunctiva; corneas clear, quiet anterior chambers, mild right cataract, posterior poles normal, IOPs 18 OD and 15 OS, CD ratio 0.4 OU. Gram stain and cultures of right eye grew Streptococcus pneumoniae sensitive to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and TMP/SMX, indicating concurrent bacterial conjunctivitis with pseudomembrane formation. Pterygia are present bilaterally; likely chronic, nonmalignant fibrovascular overgrowths (typical nasal interpalpebral location) with no corneal involvement or vision-threatening progression at this time. Management: treat acute bacterial conjunctivitis (topical antibiotic guided by sensitivities) and address inflammation/supportive care for pterygium with lubrication, UV protection, and topical steroid short course if active inflammation persists; monitor pterygium size and induced astigmatism for possible surgical removal if progressive or vision‑threatening, counseled regarding recurrence risk and adjunctive measures if surgery pursued.
Primary Diagnosis: Pterygium, bilateral
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Status post hysterectomy (10 years ago)
Differential Diagnosis: Pinguecula; Pseudopterygium (conjunctival scar); Conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (including squamous cell carcinoma)
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: persistent epithelial defects and scleral necrosis


Plan
All Medications: metoprolol preservative-free artificial tears topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications topical steroid (eg, mild topical steroid dosed four times daily and tapered over 2–3 weeks) ultraviolet-blocking sunglasses (protective measure, non-medication) topical ophthalmic antibiotics (broad-spectrum) penicillin ciprofloxacin vancomycin trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole mitomycin C topical antibiotic (postoperative, four times a day) topical corticosteroid
All Procedures: Gram stain and conjunctival culture (mucus sampling)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up dictated by severity of symptoms and proximity to visual axis; earlier follow-up if topical steroids are used (to assess response and check intraocular pressure); postoperative follow-up until surface re-epithelializes with topical antibiotic qid and steroid tapered per inflammation.
Patient Education: A pterygium is a benign, fibrovascular growth of conjunctiva often related to UV exposure and dry eye. If small and not affecting vision, it can be observed and managed conservatively with frequent preservative‑free artificial tears, UV‑blocking sunglasses, and avoidance of irritants. For active inflammation, a short course of mild topical steroid (e.g., four times daily with a 2–3 week taper) or topical NSAIDs can reduce symptoms. Surgery is considered if the pterygium grows over the visual axis, induces significant astigmatism, causes severe symptoms, or for cosmetic concerns; discuss recurrence risk (commonly up to ~35–40% without adjuncts) and options to lower recurrence (conjunctival autograft, amniotic membrane, mitomycin C with caution). If surgery is performed, expect topical antibiotic until re‑epithelialization and a corticosteroid taper postoperatively. Seek prompt care for rapid growth, atypical appearance, or persistent inflammation to rule out malignancy.


CASE 05 — Recurrent Erosion/Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy
==================================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "intermittent symptoms of bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 32-year-old lifeguard with intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation; episodes consistent with recurrent epithelial erosions on background of epithelial basement membrane (map-dot-fingerprint) dystrophy; visual acuity 20/20 OU.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy) of both eyes, with intermittent bilateral red eye, dryness, irritation, and foreign body sensation; visual acuity 20/20 OU; slit-lamp exam consistent with EBMD (superficial gray-white map and dot changes) and diffuse sheet-like epithelial sloughing during acute episodes. Plan: acute management to promote epithelial healing and comfort (topical prophylactic antibiotic ointment and pressure patch 24–48 hrs, cycloplegia as needed, consider soft bandage contact lens or self-retained amniotic membrane graft), gentle total epithelial debridement if indicated acutely with avoidance of Bowman’s layer, and for recurrent or visually significant disease consider anterior stromal micropuncture or excimer laser PTK; maintain lubrication with nonpreserved artificial tears 4–8× daily and ointment at bedtime, consider 5% sodium chloride drops/ointment for 3+ months to promote epithelial adherence; careful follow-up until defect resolution and monitor for infectious keratitis.
Primary Diagnosis: Recurrent epithelial erosion syndrome, basement membrane dystrophy type
Differential Diagnosis: Recurrent corneal epithelial erosion from epithelial basement membrane dystrophy; Traumatic recurrent corneal erosion; Herpetic keratitis causing recurrent epithelial defects; Dry eye–related epithelial breakdown
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Delayed corneal wound healing; refractive changes; secondary infectious keratitis; “tight lens syndrome” from bandage contact lens; subepithelial scarring (if Bowman’s layer violated)


Plan
All Medications: topical antibiotic ointment; cycloplegia; soft bandage contact lens (therapeutic device); self‑retained amniotic membrane grafts (Prokera, AmbioDisk; biologic grafts); topical antibiotic ointment (post‑procedural); 5% sodium chloride drops; 5% sodium chloride ointment; nonpreserved artificial tears; artificial tear ointment
All Procedures: - Prophylactic topical antibiotic ointment application - Pressure patching (24–48 hours) - Cycloplegia - Soft bandage contact lens placement - Self-retained amniotic membrane graft placement (cryopreserved Prokera or dehydrated AmbioDisk) - Epithelial debridement / scraping (manual epithelial removal) - Total epithelial debridement over entire cornea - Anterior stromal micropuncture (15–25 micropunctures with bent 25‑g needle) - Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK)
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful follow-up until the epithelial defect has fully healed; monitor closely for infectious keratitis. After resolution, maintain lubrication with non‑preserved artificial tears 4–8×/day and artificial tear ointment at bedtime. Consider 5% sodium chloride drops during the day and 5% sodium chloride ointment at bedtime for ≥3 months as alternative/adjunct to promote epithelial adherence. Consider corneal topography if irregular astigmatism or haze/visual changes.
Patient Education: Explain that epithelial basement membrane (map‑dot‑fingerprint) dystrophy is a common, usually bilateral corneal condition that causes recurrent corneal erosions (sudden pain, tearing, light sensitivity). Reassure that vision is often normal between episodes but irregularity or scarring can affect vision. Acute care aims to promote healing and prevent infection: antibiotic ointment, pressure patch or bandage contact lens, cycloplegic drops for pain, and possible self‑retained amniotic membrane. Report increasing pain, discharge, worsening vision, or fever immediately. Long‑term options to reduce recurrences include regular lubrication with preservative‑free artificial tears 4–8×/day and ointment at night, consider 5% sodium chloride drops by day and ointment at bedtime for several months, and, for frequent recurrences, procedures such as epithelial debridement, anterior stromal micropuncture, or PTK may be recommended. Advise follow‑up until the epithelial defect heals and routine monitoring with corneal topography if visual symptoms persist.
Work Restrictions: Avoid swimming and activities with high risk of ocular trauma; avoid contact lens wear until healed; may require limited duties while symptomatic or until epithelial defect heals (24–48 hr patching/bandage) and reduced duty during recovery.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care if you develop worsening eye pain, rapidly decreased vision, increasing redness, purulent discharge, or signs of infection; for severe persistent pain not controlled with prescribed medications; or if symptoms suggest corneal ulceration (white spot on cornea) — go to an emergency eye clinic or the nearest emergency department.


CASE 06 — Fuchs’ Corneal Dystrophy
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: worse vision in the morning (diurnal blur) due to corneal edema
LATERALITY: OU
PATIENT QUOTES: "I awoke from sleep with sudden onset of pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening my eyes."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 35-year-old woman with a history of multiple similar episodes in either eye awoke from sleep with sudden onset of unilateral pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening her eyes; symptoms began upon awakening that morning, with no antecedent trauma, and her mother has had similar episodes.
History Narrative: A 35-year-old woman awoke from sleep with sudden onset of unilateral pain, foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and blurred vision immediately upon opening her eyes. The patient had a previous history of multiple similar episodes occurring in either eye. The patient’s mother has also been affected with similar episodes. She had no history of prior ocular trauma. Visual acuity is 20/400 in the involved eye and 20/20 in the fellow eye. Slit-lamp examination of the involved eye revealed a large, discrete area of epithelial sloughing with “heaped-up” edges and pooling of fluorescein over the epithelial defect; no infiltrate was apparent. Examination of the fellow eye was remarkable for diffuse, superficial gray-white opacities in a “map” and “dot” configuration.
Symptom Onset: Upon awakening / immediately upon opening her eyes
Progression: Slowly progressive
Characteristics: slowly progressive dystrophy with corneal stromal edema, loss of endothelial cell density, corneal guttata, diurnal vision fluctuation (worse in morning), increased corneal thickness on pachymetry


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Morning hours (diurnal variation with worse vision in the morning), activities that induce corneal edema (e.g., eye closure/sleep), advancing endothelial failure (progression of disease)
Alleviating Factors: - Hypertonic sodium chloride (e.g., NaCl 5%) drops (especially upon awakening) - Hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime - Using a hair dryer on lowest setting directed at the cornea at arm’s length for several minutes
Associated Symptoms: corneal pain; foreign body sensation; tearing (lacrimation); photophobia; blurred vision; diurnal vision fluctuation (worse in morning); morning blur
Previous Episodes: Multiple similar episodes occurring in either eye
Impact on Daily Activities: May experience morning visual blurring that interferes with morning activities; progressive vision decline may eventually limit daily tasks, particularly reading/driving, unless treated.
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: Mother
Risk Factors: Age (older age), female sex, positive family history/genetic predisposition, endothelial cell loss (corneal endothelial dysfunction), corneal guttata/pachymetry changes (thicker cornea), prior ocular surgery/trauma (as exacerbating factor)

Fundus Exam – Macula: Macula: flat, normal and with no edema or hemorrhage


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 1. Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy OU — slowly progressive endothelial cell loss with corneal guttata and episodic stromal/epithelial edema producing morning blur; increased central corneal thickness on pachymetry and reduced endothelial cell count on specular microscopy expected. 2. Cataract OU contributing to decreased visual potential; consider combined surgery planning when corneal transplantation indicated. 3. Conservative measures instituted for mild edema: hypertonic NaCl 5% drops (and bedtime ointment) and temporary corneal dehydration techniques; monitor for progression. 4. Surgical indications when vision functionally impaired despite medical therapy: endothelial transplantation (DSAEK or DMEK preferred for isolated endothelial failure) versus PKP if there is significant corneal scarring; counsel regarding risks, refractive shifts (DSAEK hyperopic shift ~1.0–1.5 D), and perioperative planning including combined cataract extraction/IOL when lens opacity present. 5. Postoperative plan: topical antibiotics and prolonged steroid taper (6–12 months), minimize preservative exposure, supine positioning after endothelial grafts until bubble resolves, and suture/astigmatism management after PKP with topography-guided adjustments and visual rehabilitation with spectacles or RGP as needed.
Primary Diagnosis: Fuchs’ corneal dystrophy OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Cataract OU
Differential Diagnosis: Recurrent corneal epithelial erosion syndrome (secondary to map‑dot‑fingerprint dystrophy); Map‑dot‑fingerprint (epithelial basement membrane) dystrophy; Traumatic corneal abrasion; Other anterior basement membrane dystrophies (Meesmann’s, Reis–Bücklers)
Laterality: OU


Plan
All Medications: hypertonic sodium chloride ophthalmic solution (NaCl 5% drops), hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at bedtime, topical antibiotic drops, topical corticosteroid drops, nonpreserved artificial tears
All Procedures: DSAEK; DMEK; penetrating keratoplasty (PKP); corneal transplantation; cataract extraction with intraocular lens (IOL) placement; simultaneous cataract extraction and IOL placement; suturing techniques (16‑bite interrupted, running, combined running–interrupted); selective suture lysis; running suture adjustment; astigmatic keratotomy; compression sutures; wedge resection; repeat PKP; LASIK
Follow-Up Instructions: - Postoperative topical antibiotic and corticosteroid drops; discontinue antibiotics after surface re-epithelialization and taper steroids slowly over 6–12 months. - Use ointments and/or nonpreserved artificial tears as needed to rehabilitate the ocular surface. - Minimize number and frequency of preserved topical drops to avoid surface toxicity. - After DSAEK/DMEK: remain supine until the air bubble is absorbed to facilitate graft attachment. - After PKP: manage postoperative astigmatism with selective suture lysis and/or running suture adjustment guided by topography; prescribe glasses or RGP lenses as appropriate. - Consider surgical interventions for high astigmatism (astigmatic keratotomy, compression sutures, wedge resection, or repeat PKP) or LASIK only after all sutures removed and wound secure.
Patient Education: In early Fuchs’ dystrophy you may be asymptomatic or notice “morning blur” from corneal swelling; measures to reduce symptoms include using hypertonic sodium chloride drops (e.g., 5% NaCl) on awakening and hypertonic ointment at bedtime, and simple dehydration with a hair dryer on the lowest setting held at arm’s length for several minutes. As disease progresses, these measures may become inadequate and endothelial transplantation (DSAEK or DMEK) or, if scarring is present, penetrating keratoplasty may be required. Postoperatively you’ll use topical antibiotics until the surface heals and corticosteroid drops tapered over 6–12 months; after endothelial grafting you must remain supine until the air bubble resolves to allow graft attachment.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 60-year-old woman with bilateral keratoconus, right eye mild and functioning well with rigid gas-permeable contact lens (achieving 20/30), left eye more advanced with decreased vision; not correctable with glasses or soft contacts. Plan: continue rigid gas-permeable lens management for right eye, monitor left eye for progression and consider corneal collagen cross-linking to slow progression if indicated; surgical options (DALK or PKP, or intracorneal ring segments) reserved for contact lens intolerance, progressive thinning/scarring, or inadequate vision with hard contacts. Follow with serial corneal topography/pachymetry and routine contact lens fitting/rehabilitation.
Primary Diagnosis: Keratoconus in the right eye
Differential Diagnosis: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy; Pseudophakic/aphakic bullous keratopathy; Posterior polymorphous dystrophy; Corneal hydrops from keratoconus
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: residual astigmatism, myopia, glaucoma, cataract, mydriasis, risk of graft rejection


Plan
All Procedures: glasses; soft contact lenses; rigid gas permeable contact lenses; scleral lenses; specialty hybrid contact lenses; ultraviolet light/riboflavin corneal collagen cross-linking; intracorneal ring segments (INTACS); penetrating keratoplasty (PKP); deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK); Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK); Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK)
Follow-Up Instructions: This patient has done well in a rigid gas permeable contact lens for the right eye. The left eye may eventually show changes consistent with keratoconus.
Patient Education: Keratoconus is a noninflammatory thinning and bulging of the cornea that usually affects both eyes but often unequally. It causes irregular astigmatism and decreased vision that may be worse on waking. Mild disease is managed with glasses, soft lenses, or rigid gas-permeable/scleral/specialty lenses; your vision may improve markedly with a properly fitted rigid lens. Progressive disease can be slowed with corneal collagen cross-linking. If contact lenses no longer provide good vision or scarring develops, surgical options include intracorneal ring segments, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), or penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Regular follow-up with corneal topography and pachymetry is recommended to monitor progression. If you have new pain, sudden vision loss, or intolerance of contacts, contact your eye doctor promptly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 19-year-old contact lens–wearing man with central stromal necrotic-appearing corneal ulcer of the left eye consistent with culture-positive Streptococcal bacterial keratitis. Features include epithelial defect with dense gray-white stromal infiltrate and thinning; vision threatened. Risk factors: contact lens use. Urgent aggressive broad-spectrum topical antibiotic therapy indicated, with consideration of fortified antibiotics ± fluoroquinolone, close monitoring for response, and surgical intervention (glue or penetrating keratoplasty) if impending or actual perforation. Use topical steroids only cautiously after adequate antimicrobial coverage and clinical improvement.
Primary Diagnosis: Streptococcal corneal ulcer, left eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal); Contact lens wear; Penicillin allergy
Differential Diagnosis: Bacterial keratitis (e.g., Streptococcal keratitis); Acanthamoeba keratitis; Fungal keratitis; Herpetic (HSV) keratitis
Severity: Central (moderate)
Laterality: Left eye
Complications: - Corneal scarring - Persisting decreased vision - Corneal thinning and ectasia - Corneal perforation and globe collapse - Need for therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty or graft failure - Risk of graft reinfection or poor graft survival - Possible need for glue or conjunctival/surgical repair complications


Plan
All Medications: acetaminophen penicillin fortified antibiotics fluoroquinolones aminoglycosides cephalosporins penicillins synthetic penicillins erythromycin bacitracin polymyxin chloramphenicol vancomycin tetracycline sulfonamides rifampin moxifloxacin prednisolone sodium phosphate doxycycline
All Procedures: diagnostic stains, culture, sensitivities, topical fortified antibiotics, topical fluoroquinolones, subconjunctival antibiotic injection, hospitalization for IV antibiotics, topical corticosteroid drops (adjunctive), cycloplegics, doxycycline (enzyme inhibitor), collagen shields, bandage contact lenses, self‑retained amniotic grafts, corneal glue, penetrating keratoplasty, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, conjunctival flap (not indicated), phototherapeutic keratectomy, rigid gas permeable and scleral contact lens fitting
Follow-Up Instructions: Once infection is successfully treated, evaluate and correct risk factors for recurrence (stop or modify contact lens wear, treat lid/lacrimal/conjunctival dysfunction); consider rehabilitation for scarring (rigid gas-permeable or scleral lenses, PTK, deep anterior lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty) as indicated.
Patient Education: Avoid contact lens wear until the infection is fully treated and follow all medication instructions exactly. Report any worsening pain, redness, light sensitivity, or decreased vision immediately. Complete the full course of prescribed topical antibiotics and attend all follow-up visits so healing can be monitored. Once healed, address and modify risk factors (proper contact lens hygiene, reduce eye rubbing, treat dry eye or lid disease) to reduce recurrence; discuss rehabilitation options (rigid gas-permeable or scleral lenses, possible corneal procedures) if scarring impairs vision.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care for worsening pain, sudden vision loss, increasing redness, discharge, or any signs of corneal perforation (sudden decrease in eye size/shape or aqueous leakage). If perforation or impending perforation suspected, avoid eye rubbing and cover the eye with a protective shield; do not apply pressure. Present to emergency department or corneal specialist urgently; bring current antibiotic bottles and contact lens case.

CASE 10 — Postsurgical Corneal Edema
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: ocular irritation in both eyes
DURATION: 1 week
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "burning, foreign body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, and redness, more in his right eye."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus referred for a second opinion for right-eye–predominant ocular irritation after cataract surgery, complaining of burning, foreign body sensation, sandy-gritty feeling, redness worse in the morning and late day, with reduced blink rate, worsened reading/driving, preserved emotional lacrimation, sleeps on right side; exam notable for reduced corneal sensitivity, tear breakup time <2s, low tear meniscus, diffuse conjunctival injection, positive fluorescein and rose bengal staining (more right), delayed fluorescein clearance, and postoperative decreased vision in the operated eye (initial BCVA 20/40 OD, 20/20 OS) from corneal edema attributed to preexisting low endothelial cell density.
History Narrative: A 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus presented with bilateral ocular irritation and was referred for a second opinion by an ophthalmologist for presumed unstable ocular surface/dry eye in the right eye. He complained of burning, foreign body sensation, sandy‑gritty feeling, and redness, worse in the right eye, with symptoms worse in the morning and later in the day, impairing reading and driving. He had preserved emotional lacrimation and reported sleeping on his stomach, favoring his right side. On history he had reduced blink rate. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. External exam showed no rosacea or palpable preauricular nodes; lid position and relationship to the globe were normal with loose, floppy lid tension (graded 2+ OD, 1+ OS). Slit-lamp exam showed clear, easily expressible meibomian secretions, low tear meniscus height OU, diffusely injected tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva with mixed papillary and follicular response, markedly reduced ocular sensitivity by Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometry, tear breakup time <2 seconds OU, fluorescein and rose bengal staining with superficial punctate staining and positive rose bengal over the exposure zone (more prominent OD). Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Fluorescein clearance test showed marked delayed dye clearance and decreased tear secretion in both eyes. Lens and fundus were unremarkable. After further evaluation, specular microscopy of the fellow eye revealed low endothelial cell density without guttata; the unexpected postoperative corneal edema in the operated eye was attributed to preexisting low endothelial density of undetermined etiology. He was managed with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline four times daily for one week, with complete resolution of corneal edema and final BCVA 20/20.
Progression: Resolved
Characteristics: Postsurgical corneal edema following cataract surgery, often transient but may persist; risk factors include low endothelial cell density, Fuchs’ dystrophy, complicated surgery; presents with decreased vision (e.g., 20/40 → 20/20 after treatment), corneal haze/stromal swelling; managed medically (topical steroids, hypertonic saline, aqueous suppressants) or surgically (PK, DSAEK, DMEK)


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Sleeping on his stomach preferring his right side; reduced blink rate; low tear meniscus/poor tear film (dry eye); diabetes mellitus

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 56-year-old man with postoperative corneal edema of the operated eye attributed to preexisting low corneal endothelial cell density (specifically low endothelial cell count without guttata) likely related to diabetes; fellow eye exam confirmed low endothelial cell density. Managed medically with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline, resulting in complete resolution of edema and restoration of BCVA to 20/20. Continued monitoring for endothelial dysfunction and consideration of endothelial keratoplasty if edema recurs or fails to respond to medical therapy.
Primary Diagnosis: Postsurgical corneal edema
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Preexisting endothelial disease/dysfunction (e.g., Fuchs’ or low endothelial cell density); Surgical trauma to endothelium/Descemet detachment; Toxic/endothelial chemical injury (intracameral agents, contaminants); Excessive postoperative inflammation or elevated IOP
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: wound leak, flat anterior chamber, iris incarceration in the wound, IOP elevation, primary endothelial failure, endophthalmitis, epithelial defect, graft down-growth


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (topical corticosteroid), topical hypertonic 5% sodium chloride (solution or ointment), topical ophthalmic aqueous suppressants (antiglaucoma medications), systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, preservative-free epinephrine (intracameral), preservative-free lidocaine (intracameral), antibiotics (topical/subconjunctival), cyclosporin A (systemic immunotherapy)
All Procedures: Topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone acetate 1% qid) Topical hypertonic saline solution (5% sodium chloride qid)
Patient Education: Postoperative corneal edema is often temporary and usually improves with time and appropriate treatment. Causes include preexisting endothelial disease (like low endothelial cell density or Fuchs’ dystrophy), surgical trauma, medication toxicity, inflammation, or postoperative IOP elevation. Early medical management focuses on controlling inflammation (frequent topical corticosteroids such as prednisolone acetate 1%), lowering IOP if elevated (topical or systemic agents), and reducing corneal swelling with topical hypertonic saline (5% sodium chloride solution or ointment). A therapeutic soft contact lens may help comfort and vision in mild cases. If edema persists despite medical therapy, surgical options include endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK or DMEK) or, less commonly now, penetrating keratoplasty; decisions are typically deferred 2–3 months to allow for possible spontaneous recovery. Follow all medication instructions, report worsening vision, pain, redness, or discharge promptly, and attend scheduled follow-up visits for monitoring.
Referrals: Referred by an ophthalmologist for a second opinion.


CASE 11 — Dellen
================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: right eye
PATIENT QUOTES: "decreased vision (especially at night) in both eyes for 1 year." "persistent blurred vision without major discomfort."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 55‑year‑old man with 1‑year history of decreased vision (worse at night) in both eyes, with well‑controlled diabetes mellitus for 10 years, presenting for evaluation; visual acuity 20/50 OD and 20/100 OS, and cataract diagnosed OU with recommendation for left eye cataract surgery. Postoperatively on day 1 after uncomplicated left phacoemulsification via temporal clear corneal incision, he had persistent blurred vision and slit‑lamp exam showed diffuse central and incision‑site corneal edema OS with visual acuity 20/100 and IOP 18 mm Hg.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man with a 10-year history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus presented with a 1-year history of decreased vision, worse at night, in both eyes. Past ocular and family histories were unremarkable. He was found to have bilateral moderate nuclear sclerotic cataracts (left worse than right) with best corrected visual acuity 20/50 OD and 20/100 OS, normal pupils and motility, IOPs 12 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS, no visual field loss by confrontation, and no diabetic retinopathy on fundus exam. Potential acuity testing showed 20/25 in each eye. A diagnosis of bilateral cataract was made and left eye cataract surgery was recommended. He underwent uncomplicated temporal clear corneal phacoemulsification with posterior chamber acrylic IOL implantation in the left eye. On postoperative day one his visual acuity was 20/100, IOP 18 mm Hg, and slit-lamp exam showed diffuse central and incision-site corneal edema with persistent blurred vision.
Symptom Onset: 1 year
Symptom Duration: 1 year
Characteristics: - Area of peripheral, localized corneal thinning due to desiccation of epithelial and subepithelial tissues - Occurs adjacent to areas of limbal elevation (e.g., filtering blebs, dermoids, conjunctival elevation) - Results from poor tear coverage/tear film interruption over a specific area - Typically well-circumscribed peripheral lesion - Noninfiltrated, relatively quiet (noninflammatory) process - Associated with dry eye and may be accompanied by pooling of fluorescein in the area

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Delle in right eye due to dry eye in the setting of a filtering bleb.
Primary Diagnosis: Delle in right eye due to dry eye in the setting of a filtering bleb
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus (well-controlled)
Differential Diagnosis: Dellen secondary to localized tear-film disruption (adjacent to conjunctival/limbal elevation); Peripheral ulcerative keratitis from autoimmune/inflammatory disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener’s); Terrien’s marginal degeneration (or other peripheral degenerations such as pellucid marginal degeneration)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: corneal thinning (dellen) leading to potential keratolysis and risk of progressive corneal thinning/nonhealing requiring bandage contact lens, amniotic membrane graft, tarsorrhaphy, or surgical intervention (possible removal of offending conjunctival elevation)


Plan
All Medications: preservative-free artificial tears; bland ophthalmic lubricating ointment; oral doxycycline; vitamin C; bandage contact lens (therapeutic contact lens); self-retained amniotic membrane graft; heat compresses (lid hygiene); LipiFlow thermal pulsation system (device)
All Procedures: phacoemulsification via temporal clear corneal incision with implantation of a posterior chamber acrylic intraocular lens (left eye)
Follow-Up Instructions: Patients should be observed and treated long-term for signs and symptoms of dry eye contributing to dellen formation, with periodic follow-up to monitor healing and corneal stability and to adjust therapy as needed.
Patient Education: Dellen are localized areas of corneal thinning caused by poor tear coverage, often next to a raised area at the limbus (e.g., filtering bleb, conjunctival mass). They are not the same as inflammatory ulcers but need treatment to prevent progression. Treatment focuses on improving tear protection and lid hygiene: use preservative‑free artificial tears frequently, apply lubricating ointment at bedtime, consider punctual occlusion if directed, warm compresses and gentle lid massage for meibomian gland dysfunction, and treat blepharitis/meibomitis as instructed. If healing is slow, your doctor may add a bandage contact lens, oral doxycycline and vitamin C, or place an amniotic membrane graft; rarely a temporary tarsorrhaphy or removal of an offending mass is needed. Return promptly for worsening pain, increasing redness, a new white spot, or vision loss. Keep long‑term follow‑up to manage dry eye and prevent recurrence.


CASE 12 — Graft Rejection Following Penetrating Keratoplasty
============================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision, red eye, photophobia, and foreign body sensation two weeks after surgery
LATERALITY: OD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with a history of glaucoma treated with multiple filtration procedures who developed elevated intraocular pressure on maximal medical therapy leading to a repeat trabeculectomy with a new flap at the 7 o’clock position; two weeks postoperatively he was found to have a moderately elevated filtering bleb from 5 to 8 o’clock and peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to the bleb with fluorescein pooling and a small area of epithelial cell loss.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man with a history of glaucoma that required multiple filtration procedures in the right eye was found to have elevated intraocular pressure on maximal medical therapy. A repeat trabeculectomy was performed with the flap established at the 7 o’clock position to avoid the prior surgical site, resulting in a moderately elevated filtering bleb extending from the 5 to 8 o’clock positions. Two weeks after surgery, peripheral corneal thinning adjacent to the filtering bleb was noted; fluorescein instillation revealed pooling with a small area of epithelial cell loss.

CASE 13 — Blepharitis
=====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: redness, photophobia, and blurred vision in his right eye for 1 week
DURATION: 1 week
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 30-year-old man with a history of keratoconus and right eye penetrating keratoplasty 5 months prior presented with 1 week of right eye redness, photophobia, and blurred vision. One month earlier his right eye VA was 20/60 improving to 20/30 with pinhole. On current exam the right eye VA was 20/400 (no pinhole improvement), IOP 17 mm Hg OU, with 2+ ciliary flush, a broken exposed interrupted suture with surrounding infiltrate at the 11 o’clock meridian of the graft, marked stromal edema extending 2 mm into the graft, a line of keratic precipitates at the edge of edema, and 1+ cell and flare in the anterior chamber. The left eye was quiet with contact lens wear and known central corneal thinning and mild protrusion from keratoconus. He also had symptoms and exam findings of dry eye with inferior punctate keratopathy, diminished tear lake, and a positive Schirmer’s test.
History Narrative: A 30-year-old man presented with complaints of redness, photophobia, and blurred vision in his right eye for 1 week. Past ocular history included keratoconus, for which he had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (PK) in the right eye 5 months earlier. At his examination 1 month earlier, a visual acuity of 20/60 in the right eye with improvement to 20/30 with pinhole had been recorded.
Symptom Onset: 1 week
Symptom Duration: 1 week
Progression: Chronic, relapsing condition
Characteristics: Staphylococcal anterior blepharitis with crusting debris at eyelash bases, disruption of eyelid margin architecture, and madarosis (loss of eyelashes).


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Frequent or rough handling of the eyelids (mechanical irritation), contact lens wear, exposure to infected individuals, dermatologic conditions (eczema/rosacea/seborrhea), seasonal allergens, poor eyelid hygiene, meibomian gland dysfunction, dry eye/aqueous tear deficiency, recurrent ocular surface inflammation.
Alleviating Factors: Eyelid hygiene (mechanical debridement/lid scrubs), warm compresses, gentle eyelid massage to express meibomian secretions, preservative‑free artificial tears (4–8×/day), topical antibiotic ointment at bedtime, short‑course topical steroids, omega‑3 fatty acid supplementation
Associated Symptoms: redness, photophobia, blurred vision
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — significant ocular surface discomfort with redness, photophobia, blurred vision in right eye (VA reduced to 20/400) affecting vision-dependent activities; chronic, relapsing condition requiring ongoing eyelid hygiene and treatments.
Risk Factors: Staphylococcal eyelid colonization (S. aureus, S. epidermidis); seborrheic dermatitis; meibomian gland dysfunction; rosacea (ocular acne rosacea); contact lens wear; dermatologic conditions (eczema); dry eye disease/aqueous tear deficiency; recurrent eyelid inflammation/chronic relapsing eyelid hygiene neglect; prior ocular surgery (e.g., PK) as a potential contributor; exposure to infected individuals; age-related meibomian gland changes; use of topical ocular medications (medicamentosa).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Anterior blepharitis, staphylococcal type, chronic and relapsing, associated with dry eye/aqueous tear deficiency. Patient also has history of right penetrating keratoplasty with prior visual acuity decline and current findings consistent with blepharitis (lid margin crusting, madarosis) and ocular surface disease (inferior punctate keratopathy, diminished tear lake, positive Schirmer). Management plan: emphasize meticulous eyelid hygiene (lid scrubs, warm compresses), topical antibiotic ointment at bedtime (e.g., erythromycin/bacitracin) for bacterial colonization, preservative-free artificial tears 4–8×/day for tear deficiency, consider short-pulse topical steroid for significant inflammation, and oral doxycycline or topical azithromycin if meibomian involvement or refractory disease. Consider culture if refractory, and evaluate for eyelid malignancy if unilateral/recurrent or atypical. Follow-up in 3–6 weeks or sooner if steroids used; long-term maintenance regimen required.
Primary Diagnosis: Anterior blepharitis, staphylococcal type.
Secondary Diagnoses: Keratoconus; Status post penetrating keratoplasty (right eye); Dry eye disease (aqueous tear deficiency)
Differential Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis; Dry eye syndrome; Giant papillary conjunctivitis; Pediculosis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: - Chronic, relapsing ocular surface disease with recurring symptoms - Structural eyelid damage (poliosis, madarosis, lid ulceration, loss of eyelash/lid architecture) - Meibomian gland atrophy and dysfunction leading to evaporative dry eye - Inferior punctate epithelial erosions, corneal infiltrates, neovascularization, thinning, phlyctenules - Marginal keratitis and sterile marginal infiltrates - Recurrent chalazia and potential need for surgical correction (lid malposition/scarring) - Secondary infection from bacterial colonization (including MRSA) - Misdiagnosis of underlying malignancy (sebaceous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, rarely melanoma)


Plan
All Medications: erythromycin ointment sulfacetamide ointment bacitracin ointment topical steroids (short-pulse) preservative-free artificial tears hypochlorous acid 0.01% lid cleansing solution topical azithromycin ophthalmic solution oral minocycline doxycycline 50–100 mg orally twice daily tetracycline 250 mg orally four times daily oral omega-3 fatty acid (DHA/EPA) 1–3 g/day
All Procedures: Lid hygiene/lid scrubs (mechanical debridement with cotton‑tip applicator or mild shampoo), topical antibiotic ointment application (e.g., erythromycin, sulfacetamide, bacitracin) at bedtime, warm compresses, gentle eyelid massage (meibomian expression), topical steroids (short‑pulse), preservative‑free artificial tears (4–8×/day), topical azithromycin ophthalmic solution, oral antibiotics for MGD (doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline), oral omega‑3 fatty acid supplementation (1–3 g/day), eyelid bacterial culture and sensitivity testing, eyelid biopsy (for refractory/unilateral suspicious cases), LipiFlow thermal pulsation, intense pulsed light (IPL)
Follow-Up Instructions: Mild blepharitis: follow as needed or at next routine visit. More severe cases: return in 3–6 weeks (sooner if on topical steroids to monitor response and IOP). Emphasize ongoing maintenance eyelid hygiene, artificial tears, and warm compresses; tailor regimen to symptom severity.
Patient Education: Blepharitis is a chronic, relapsing eyelid condition; meticulous, daily eyelid hygiene is essential. Perform gentle lid scrubs (cotton-tip or commercial lid cleansers, e.g., hypochlorous 0.01% or mild shampoo) once or twice daily and use warm compresses to soften debris and help express glands. Avoid rough or frequent handling of the lids. Use preservative‑free artificial tears 4–8×/day for associated dry eye. Apply topical antibiotic ointment at bedtime if prescribed for staphylococcal disease. Short courses of topical steroids may be used briefly for severe inflammation under close follow-up (monitor IOP). Consider oral omega‑3 supplements (1–3 g/day DHA/EPA) for meibomian dysfunction; oral antibiotics (doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline) may be used for refractory cases but are contraindicated in children and pregnant/nursing women. Return for follow-up in 3–6 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen; report unilateral, persistent, or unusual lid changes (nodules, recurrent chalazia, ulceration, loss of normal lid architecture) as these may require biopsy to exclude malignancy. Maintenance therapy is usually lifelong to prevent recurrences.

CASE 15 — Retained Lens Material after Cataract Extraction
==========================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Evaluation of a nearly mature cataract in the right eye with pain, blurred vision, and elevated intraocular pressure.
DURATION: 4 days
LATERALITY: Right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 34-year-old Caucasian woman referred for evaluation of a nearly mature right cataract with complex ocular history including a phthisical left eye and congenital glaucoma; prior multiple right-eye surgeries (goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, trabeculectomy); presenting with finger-counting vision in the right eye, dense nearly mature right cataract, 3-mm pupil with 360° posterior synechiae and iris atrophy, functioning superior-nasal filtering bleb, IOP 20 mm Hg, deep quiet anterior chamber, absence/questionable zonules, no view of the right fundus.
History Narrative: A 34-year-old Caucasian woman was referred by a glaucoma specialist for evaluation of a nearly mature cataract in her right eye. She had a complex ocular history including a phthisical left eye and congenital glaucoma status post numerous surgical procedures in the right eye including goniotomies, peripheral iridectomies, sphincterotomies, and a trabeculectomy. On examination, visual acuity was finger counting in the right and no light perception in the left. Examination of the right eye suggested that the patient was using her superior nasal peripheral iridotomy as an entrance pupil. There was a relatively thick-walled but functioning filtering bleb in the superior nasal quadrant. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 20 mm Hg without glaucoma medications. A few corneal guttae were observed. The anterior chamber was deep and quiet. The iris was highly atrophic throughout its entire periphery, with very little sphincter tissue. The pupil measured 3 mm and did not dilate due to 360 degrees of posterior synechiae. There were multiple sphincterotomies at the pupillary margin and a large radial cut at the 12 o’clock position. There was a dense, nearly mature cataract, an absence of zonules visible through the large superior nasal iridectomy, and questionable zonular status in the areas of broad peripheral iridectomies in two other quadrants. There was no view of the right fundus.
Progression: Resolved

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Lens particle glaucoma — patient with retained lens fragments after cataract extraction presenting weeks after lens capsule disruption with elevated IOP and anterior chamber lens remnants. Gonioscopy demonstrated open angles, B-scan showed flat retina. Clinical picture distinguished from angle-closure, phacolytic, phacoantigenic glaucoma, iridocyclitis, and angle-recession glaucoma based on history and exam. Management initiated with multiple aqueous suppressants (topical beta-blocker, alpha-2 agonist, topical and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), frequent topical corticosteroids, and cycloplegic/mydriatic (atropine). Given persistent elevated IOP and need for IOL placement, patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy, lensectomy, and IOL implantation 4 days after presentation. Postoperatively IOP normalized to 12 mm Hg off medications and final uncorrected visual acuity improved to 20/30.
Primary Diagnosis: Lens particle glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Lens particle glaucoma; congenital glaucoma; phthisical left eye; corneal guttae; posterior synechiae; iris atrophy; prior trabeculectomy with functioning filtering bleb
Differential Diagnosis: Angle-closure glaucoma; Phacolytic glaucoma; Phacoantigenic (phacoantigenic) glaucoma; Iridocyclitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: lens particle glaucoma; ocular hypertension; inflammation; retinal detachment; hemorrhage; chronic inflammation; disabling visual floaters; refractory cystoid macular edema


Plan
All Medications: timolol; dorzolamide; brimonidine; atropine; prednisolone acetate; topical beta-blocker; alpha-2-adrenergic agonist; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; glycerin (mentioned as to avoid in diabetics); isosorbide; mannitol; frequent topical corticosteroids; periocular or systemic corticosteroids; prostaglandin analogs (typically not used)
All Procedures: pars plana vitrectomy; lensectomy; intraocular lens (IOL) placement; gonioscopy; keratometry; corneal topography; axial length measurement; B-scan ultrasonography; topical ocular hypotensive therapy (timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine); topical atropine; topical prednisolone acetate
Patient Education: Explain that retained lens fragments after cataract surgery can cause inflammation and high eye pressure (lens particle glaucoma), requiring urgent treatment to protect vision; initial care includes multiple pressure-lowering eye drops, frequent steroid drops, and cycloplegics to reduce inflammation and prevent synechiae; if pressure or inflammation persists or if vitreous prolapse, hemorrhage, retinal detachment, or disabling symptoms occur, pars plana vitrectomy with removal of lens fragments (and possible secondary IOL placement) is recommended—timing is individualized but often within days to weeks; risks of delayed surgery include persistent inflammation, glaucoma, and retinal detachment; report any worsening pain, redness, vision loss, flashes/floaters, or increased discharge immediately; attend all follow-up visits and adhere strictly to prescribed drops and systemic medications (e.g., oral acetazolamide or IV mannitol in emergencies) so optic nerve damage can be prevented.
Referrals: Glaucoma specialist

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 47-year-old man with history of bungee cord trauma to the left eye and complicated cataract surgery of that eye 9 months earlier, lost to follow-up, presenting to retina clinic with 2 months of decreased vision, redness, and pain in the left eye; vision 20/400 OS, IOP OS 38 mm Hg, exam notable for mild conjunctival injection, 2+ AC cell and flare, iridodonesis, ectopia lentis, prolapsed vitreous, lens fragments inferiorly on gonioscopy, crystalline lens subluxated inferiorly in anterior vitreous.
History Narrative: A 47-year-old man with a history of bungee cord trauma to the left eye had undergone a complicated cataract surgery 9 months earlier. He was lost to follow-up and presented to the retina clinic with a 2-month history of decreased vision, redness, and pain in the left eye. His visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressures were 12 mm Hg OD and 38 mm Hg OS. Pupils were reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Right eye exam was unremarkable aside from a mild cataract. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the left eye revealed mild conjunctival injection, 2+ anterior chamber cell and flare, iridodonesis, ectopia lentis, and prolapsed vitreous. Gonioscopy of the left eye demonstrated a wide open angle with lens fragments noted inferiorly. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed a posterior vitreous detachment with the crystalline lens subluxated inferiorly in the anterior vitreous; macula, retinal vessels, and optic nerve were unremarkable.
Symptom Onset: 2 months
Symptom Duration: 2 months
Progression: Progressive — subacute worsening over 2 months with chronic postoperative inflammation leading to decreased vision, redness, and pain.
Characteristics: Fibrin deposition over the intraocular lens implant occurring 2–14 days postoperatively; presents with decreased vision, red eye, pain, photophobia; slit‑lamp shows cellular anterior chamber reaction without hypopyon, fibrin as strands on IOL/pupillary plane/iris or dense membrane covering pupil; immune‑mediated due to blood–aqueous barrier breakdown allowing fibrinogen leakage and fibrin formation; associated macrophages/giant cells; complications: posterior synechiae, IOL membrane formation/dislocation, glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, posterior capsular opacification.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 47-year-old man with history of complicated cataract surgery OS presenting with 2 months of decreased vision, redness, and pain OS. Exam OS: VA 20/400, IOP 38 mmHg, 2+ AC cell and flare, iridodonesis, ectopia lentis with prolapsed vitreous, lens fragments inferiorly in the angle, and subluxated crystalline lens in the anterior vitreous. Findings consistent with postoperative fibrin deposition on the IOL with secondary inflammatory reaction and elevated IOP—diagnosis: postoperative fibrin deposition on the intraocular lens OS with associated lens-particle/secondary glaucoma and vitreo-lenticular subluxation following prior complicated cataract surgery. Management focused on controlling intraocular inflammation (topical corticosteroids; consider systemic steroids if severe) and IOP, with consideration of intracameral tPA for refractory fibrin and surgical intervention (AC washout, membranectomy or lens/IOL removal) if medically refractory or if IOL/lens is causative. Follow-up for IOP, inflammation, and risk of cystoid macular edema and infection.
Primary Diagnosis: Postoperative fibrin deposition on the intraocular lens
Differential Diagnosis: Fibrinous postoperative anterior uveitis (fibrin deposition on IOL); Acute postoperative endophthalmitis; Lens-particle/inflammatory glaucoma from retained lens fragments; Persistent uveitic reaction (including autoimmune or infectious anterior uveitis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: AC turbidity; corneal edema; elevated intraocular pressure; bleeding; corneal toxicity; band keratopathy; endophthalmitis; posterior synechiae; loss of iris function; membrane formation on the IOL; dislocation of the IOL; glaucoma; cystoid macular edema; posterior capsular opacification; infectious keratitis


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% (topical) — one drop 4–6 times daily, up to hourly as needed; topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (topical NSAIDs) (preoperative use); systemic steroids (for severe cases); intraoperative subconjunctival steroid injection; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) — intracameral injection (doses as low as 3 μg)
All Procedures: intracameral tPA injection topical prednisolone acetate administration intraoperative subconjunctival steroid injection anterior chamber washout (fibrin membranectomy) IOL removal (explantation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Regular eye examinations at regular intervals to monitor visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and signs of infection or recurrent inflammation.
Patient Education: Fibrin on the lens is inflammation after eye surgery that can cause decreased vision, redness, pain, and light sensitivity. It usually appears days to two weeks after surgery. The main treatment is frequent topical steroid drops (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%) to reduce inflammation; you may need them hourly at first and then tapered as the eye improves. In severe cases, a medication called tPA can be injected into the front of the eye to dissolve fibrin, but this has rare risks (corneal swelling, higher eye pressure, bleeding, infection). Surgery (washout or lens removal) is rarely needed unless the lens is causing ongoing problems. Follow-up visits are important to monitor vision, pressure, and signs of infection or recurrent inflammation; report worsening pain, sudden vision loss, increasing redness, discharge, or fever immediately. Use drops exactly as prescribed and avoid rubbing the eye.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care for sudden severe eye pain, marked vision loss, worsening redness, discharge, new floaters or flashes, or if IOP becomes very high (severe eye pressure symptoms). If signs of infection (fever, purulent discharge) or trauma occur, go to the emergency department or call your eye surgeon right away.


CASE 17 — Subluxated Crystalline Lens
=====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Photophobia
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman presented 5 days after combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye for photophobia; she had undergone the same procedures in the left eye 1 month earlier. Past medical history significant for hypertension. She was using prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours and ofloxacin four times a day in both eyes. Visual acuity 20/60 OD and 20/200 OS; slit-lamp OD: mild conjunctival injection with a low bleb, clear cornea, moderate cells and flare in the anterior chamber without hypopyon, and a fibrin meshwork on the IOL. OS: low bleb, clear cornea, rare anterior chamber cells, IOL in good position. Dilated fundus: moderate (OD) and severe (OS) glaucomatous cupping; poor vision OS due to advanced glaucoma.
History Narrative: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the eye clinic after intraocular surgery in the right eye, with a chief complaint of photophobia. Five days earlier, she had undergone combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the right eye. Her left eye had undergone the same procedures 1 month prior to presentation. Her past medical history was significant only for hypertension. Her ocular medications were prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours and ofloxacin four times a day in both eyes. Her visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/200 OS. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed mild conjunctival injection with a low bleb. The cornea was clear. The anterior chamber had moderate cells and flare with no hypopyon. There was a meshwork of fibrin deposition on the IOL. Examination of the left eye revealed a low bleb, clear cornea, and rare cells in the anterior chamber. The IOL was in good position. Dilated fundus exam was unremarkable in both eyes except for moderate and severe glaucomatous cupping of the right and left optic nerves, respectively. The poor vision in the left eye was secondary to advanced glaucoma.
Symptom Onset: 5 days earlier

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) consistent with Marfan’s syndrome — upward subluxation of the crystalline lens in the left eye. Significant zonular laxity with risk for progressive displacement, pupillary block, and retinal detachment. Visual impairment OU with advanced glaucomatous cupping (worse OS); conservative optical management may be attempted but surgical intervention (phacoemulsification with capsular support devices or pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy and appropriate IOL fixation) should be considered based on degree of decentration, visual symptoms, and complications. Recommend systemic evaluation for Marfan’s (including echocardiography) and family screening.
Primary Diagnosis: Lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) associated with Marfan’s syndrome
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Traumatic lens subluxation; Marfan’s syndrome-associated ectopia lentis; Homocystinuria (hereditary metabolic zonulopathy)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: - Cardiac abnormalities (aortic root dilation, mitral/aortic valve disease, risk of dissecting aortic aneurysm) - Retinal detachment - Glaucoma (including angle‑closure from pupillary block, optic nerve cupping/vision loss) - Corneal endothelial cell loss and corneal decompensation (from anterior chamber lens dislocation) - Amblyopia (in pediatric cases) - Intraoperative/postoperative complications of surgery: vitreous prolapse, intraocular hemorrhage, endophthalmitis, severe anterior chamber inflammation/fibrinous uveitis, hypotony - IOL complications: decentration/tilt, pigment dispersion, unpredictable refractive error, suture degradation/breakage with late IOL dislocation, conjunctival erosion from exposed scleral knots - Hemorrhage and haptic damage with intrascleral fixation


Plan
All Medications: prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours; ofloxacin four times a day
All Procedures: combined cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C; cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (left eye); phacoemulsification; pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy; anterior chamber IOL implantation; sulcus implantation of three-piece foldable IOL; sutured intracapsular device placement; three-piece posterior chamber IOL with iris or scleral suture fixation; intrascleral tunnel haptic fixation (glued IOL); anterior vitrectomy; peripheral laser iridotomy; Nd:YAG laser zonulysis; aspiration of anterior chamber and vitreous for culture and intravitreal antibiotic injection
Follow-Up Instructions: Return to clinic for postoperative follow-up as scheduled for wound and IOP check; monitor for increasing pain, redness, decreased vision, hypopyon, or vitritis (seek urgent care if these occur). Continue topical prednisolone and antibiotic as prescribed; taper steroids per surgeon’s plan. Arrange echocardiography to evaluate for aortic/valvular disease if Marfan’s not previously assessed. Long-term: regular ophthalmic follow-up for IOP and retinal exam; consider amblyopia/visual rehabilitation or secondary IOL planning as needed.
Patient Education: - Explanation that lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) is displacement of the natural lens caused by weak or broken zonules, which can cause blurred vision, double vision, glare, and increased risk of glaucoma or retinal detachment. - If bilateral and nontraumatic, importance of systemic evaluation for inherited conditions (especially Marfan’s syndrome) and referral for cardiology evaluation (echocardiography) because of risk of aortic dilation/dissection. - Conservative options: glasses or contact lenses may correct refractive changes; pupillary agents (miotics or cycloplegics) or laser iridotomy may be used temporarily to manage symptoms or pupillary block. - Indications for surgery: significant visual impairment, lens-induced glaucoma, corneal endothelial compromise, or progressive anterior dislocation; surgical options include phacoemulsification with capsular support devices, or pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy if lens is posteriorly dislocated or vitreous prolapse. - If surgery planned, discuss possible need for capsule tension rings, capsular hooks, scleral- or iris-fixated IOLs, anterior chamber IOLs, or leaving aphakic with later secondary IOL; review risks (infection, hemorrhage, IOL decentration, retinal detachment, glaucoma). - Postoperative expectations: steroid and antibiotic eye drops, monitoring for inflammation/infection, and regular glaucoma and retinal checks; report worsening pain, vision loss, or increasing redness immediately. - Family screening and genetic counseling recommended when hereditary cause suspected.
Referrals: Echocardiography for evaluation of mitral/aortic valve abnormalities and aortic dilation (cardiology referral)

Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up frequency based on disease severity, target IOP achievement, evidence of progression, and duration of control; at each visit check medication side effects and compliance, visual acuity, IOP, and examine the optic nerve; repeat visual field testing and optic nerve imaging as indicated; obtain baseline stereoscopic optic nerve photos and adjust therapy for failure to reach target IOP, progressive nerve or field loss, or medication side effects/noncompliance.
Patient Education: You have primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a condition where eye pressure is elevated and can damage the optic nerve over time. Key points and recommendations: - Nature of disease: POAG is usually slow and painless. Early disease often has no symptoms but can cause irreversible vision loss if untreated. - Goal of treatment: Lower eye pressure to a “target” level (often ≥20% below baseline) to prevent or slow further optic nerve damage and vision loss. - Tests and monitoring: Expect regular visits for eye pressure checks, gonioscopy, optic nerve examination (stereoscopic photos or OCT), and visual field tests. Central corneal thickness may be measured to help interpret pressures. - Medical therapy: First-line treatment is usually pressure-lowering eye drops (prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists, or combinations). Start in one eye initially to assess response and side effects. Take drops exactly as prescribed; missed doses reduce effectiveness. - Possible side effects and adherence: Report any local irritation, vision changes, cardiac/respiratory symptoms (with beta-blockers), or systemic effects. Bring all eye drops to visits. If cost, dosing frequency, or side effects interfere with adherence, tell your doctor—alternatives exist. - Laser and surgery options: If drops don’t reach target pressure or adherence is poor, treatments include selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) and various surgical procedures (trabeculectomy, tube implants, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery). SLT can be an initial or adjunct option and requires a short post-procedure pressure check. - When to seek urgent care: Sudden vision loss, sudden severe eye pain, halos around lights, persistent nausea/vomiting, or acute marked increase in redness/IOP—seek emergency care. - Lifestyle and general advice: Keep regular ophthalmology follow-ups, control systemic health conditions, avoid smoking, and use protective eyewear. Maintain a list of medications and inform other providers you have glaucoma. - Prognosis: With consistent treatment and monitoring, progression can often be slowed or halted. Early detection and adherence are important to preserve vision. - Next steps for you: Start/continue prescribed IOP-lowering therapy as directed (or discuss SLT if appropriate), schedule regular follow-up visits with IOP, optic nerve imaging/photography, and automated visual fields, and report any side effects or adherence issues promptly.


CASE 21 — Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma
========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Routine eye exam
DURATION: acute (onset described as acute)
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "I had no past ocular problems and no current visual complaints."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 51-year-old African American man presented for a routine eye exam with no past ocular problems and no current visual complaints; he denied repeated or prior episodes and reported an acute onset of the problem in the left eye.
History Narrative: A 51-year-old African American man presented for a routine eye exam. He had no past ocular problems and no current visual complaints. Past medical history was remarkable for mild emphysema for which he used inhalers. Examination revealed visual acuities of 20/20 in each eye, with a refraction of –3.00 +2.25 × 110 OD and –2.25 +2.00 × 86 OS. The pupils reacted normally with no afferent pupillary defect. Anterior slit-lamp examination was unremarkable, and pressures by applanation tonometry were 26 mm Hg OD and 32 mm Hg OS. Gonioscopy was performed and the angles were noted to be grade IV in both eyes with a clear view of the ciliary body band for 360 degrees. There was 1+ pigment of the trabecular meshwork. On funduscopic exam, the optic nerves were as pictured in the report. Automated visual fields were also obtained.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Narrow anterior chamber angle, at risk for subsequent angle-closure glaucoma. Left eye: Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma.
Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: Narrow anterior chamber angle, at risk for subsequent angle-closure glaucoma; Left eye: Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Mild emphysema
Differential Diagnosis: Primary (pupillary-block) angle-closure glaucoma; Plateau iris configuration; Lens-induced (phacomorphic/ectopia) angle-closure glaucoma; Secondary angle-closure from neovascular/uveitic/choroidal effusion causes
Severity: Narrow anterior chamber angle, at risk for subsequent angle-closure glaucoma (fellow eye: prophylactic risk) — Left eye: Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (acute, severe)
Laterality: Left eye


Plan
All Medications: isosorbide glycerol mannitol acetazolamide topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors pilocarpine 2% topical beta-blockers alpha-2 agonists prostaglandin analogs topical corticosteroids analgesics antiemetics
All Procedures: Laser iridotomy; prophylactic iridotomy in fellow eye; laser iridoplasty; therapeutic paracentesis; laser or surgical goniosynechialysis; cataract extraction (if lens component present)
Follow-Up Instructions: - Measure IOP within 30–120 minutes after laser surgery. - Re-examine within 1 week post-op (more frequently if inadequate response). - Re-examine again at 4–8 weeks post-op. - Taper topical corticosteroids during the postoperative period. - Perform pupillary dilation with post-dilation IOP check and gonioscopy to confirm angle remains open; consider provocative testing if indicated.
Patient Education: You have acute primary angle‑closure glaucoma in the left eye and a narrow, at‑risk angle in the right eye. Immediate goals are to lower the eye pressure and open the drainage angle to prevent vision loss. Initial medical treatment may include oral or IV osmotic agents (isosorbide, glycerol, or IV mannitol) and intravenous acetazolamide to rapidly reduce intraocular pressure, plus topical medications such as beta‑blockers or alpha‑agonists and pilocarpine to attempt to open the pupil if the iris can respond. Topical steroids reduce inflammation and analgesics/antiemetics relieve symptoms. The definitive treatment is a laser peripheral iridotomy (or iridoplasty if needed) to relieve pupillary block; the fellow eye usually receives a prophylactic iridotomy because it is at high risk. You will need close follow‑up after treatment (IOP checks within 30–120 minutes post‑procedure, at 1 week, and again at 4–8 weeks) and instruction to report worsening pain, vision loss, or nausea immediately. Avoid medications known to precipitate angle closure and bring a list of current drugs to your appointments.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic emergency care for sudden eye pain, decreased vision, nausea/vomiting, or colored halos; do not dilate the pupil; go to an ER or eye clinic promptly for urgent IOP-lowering treatment (osmotic agents, acetazolamide, topical meds) and urgent laser iridotomy or other surgical management as directed by the ophthalmologist.


CASE 22 — Pigmentary Glaucoma
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye
DURATION: several hours
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 55-year-old woman presented with several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye. She reported acute onset of blurry vision and eye discomfort; vision was 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS. No prior similar episodes documented in the case.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old woman presented with a history of several hours of discomfort and blurred vision in the left eye. She reported no prior similar episodes mentioned. Examination at presentation showed vision of 20/20 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 52 mm Hg in the left eye. The left pupil was sluggish and mid-dilated. She had mild conjunctival and episcleral vessel congestion, mild corneal epithelial edema, and a shallow peripheral anterior chamber. The midperipheral iris was markedly bowed anteriorly. The lens showed mild nuclear sclerosis. Gonioscopy of the left eye revealed marked convexity of the iris contour with no visible anterior chamber angle structures; gonioscopy of the right eye demonstrated an open, narrow anterior chamber angle. The optic nerve cups were small in both eyes. The left eye was treated with medical therapy and laser iridotomy, which opened the anterior chamber angle and reduced the IOP to normal.
Symptom Onset: several hours
Symptom Duration: several hours
Progression: Progressive
Characteristics: - A form of secondary open-angle glaucoma caused by pigment liberation from posterior iris epithelium due to iris–zonule chafing (often with posterior iris bowing); affects young myopic men more commonly; features Krukenberg spindle on corneal endothelium, dense even trabecular meshwork pigmentation, Sampaolesi’s line, exercise-induced pigment release and IOP spikes, blurry vision with exercise; may present with acute IOP elevation or chronic IOP elevation leading to trabecular sclerosis and glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 55-year-old woman with acute left eye angle-closure attack manifested by mid-dilated pupil, conjunctival injection, corneal epithelial edema, shallow peripheral anterior chamber and markedly convex (bowed) iris with IOP 52 mm Hg OS and 14 mm Hg OD. Gonioscopy OS showed closed anterior chamber angle with no visible angle structures; OD had an open but narrow angle. Optic nerves small OU. After medical therapy and laser peripheral iridotomy OS, the angle opened and IOP normalized. Diagnosis: left eye acute angle-closure glaucoma secondary to pupillary block with iris bombé, successfully treated with laser iridotomy; fellow eye narrow/occludable angle—recommend prophylactic iridotomy. Manage IOP and follow for glaucomatous damage; consider gonioscopic surveillance and visual field testing when stable.
Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: Moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma with superior arcuate defect; Left eye: Moderate-stage pigmentary glaucoma with early nasal step defect
Secondary Diagnoses: Nuclear sclerosis (mild)
Differential Diagnosis: Primary open-angle glaucoma with heavy trabecular pigmentation; Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma; Uveitic glaucoma; Intraocular melanosis/melanoma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Progressive glaucomatous optic nerve damage with visual field loss leading to irreversible vision loss; acute IOP spikes causing corneal edema and pain; trabecular meshwork sclerosis with chronic IOP elevation; medication/laser/surgical treatment–related complications (medication side effects, IOP spike after selective laser trabeculoplasty, surgical risks such as infection, hypotony, bleb failure, or implant-related complications).


Plan
All Medications: pilocarpine prostaglandin analogs beta-blockers carbonic anhydrase inhibitors alpha-adrenergic agonists
All Procedures: laser iridotomy argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) trabeculectomy Ex-Press glaucoma mini-shunt implantation glaucoma drainage implant surgery iStent trabecular micro-bypass implantation gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) endocyclophotocoagulation
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up individualized to treatment response and disease stability; schedule visits based on IOP control and progression risk, monitor visual acuity, IOP, gonioscopy, optic nerve appearance and visual fields at appropriate intervals; more frequent follow-up after treatment changes or inadequate control.
Patient Education: Pigmentary glaucoma is a type of open‑angle glaucoma caused by pigment from the back of the iris blocking drainage of eye fluid, which can raise eye pressure and damage the optic nerve. It most often affects younger, nearsighted men but can occur in others. Key points - Symptoms: blurry vision (sometimes worsened with exercise), eye discomfort, halos around lights, episodic eye redness. Some patients have no symptoms early on. - Why treatment matters: uncontrolled high eye pressure can cause irreversible vision loss. Regular monitoring and treatment aim to prevent progression. - Treatments: eye‑drop medications to lower pressure (prostaglandin analogs, beta‑blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists); laser trabeculoplasty to improve drainage; laser peripheral iridotomy in selected cases to reduce pigment release; and surgical options if other treatments fail. - Practical advice: use glaucoma medications exactly as prescribed; report side effects; bring all eye drops to visits; avoid heavy exercise if it causes vision changes until pressure is controlled; keep scheduled follow-ups for IOP checks, optic nerve exams, and visual fields. - When to seek urgent care: sudden severe eye pain, marked vision loss, persistent headache, or nausea/vomiting with eye symptoms—these may signal an acute pressure spike. - Follow‑up: regular visits are required—frequency depends on disease severity and response to treatment. Early detection and consistent treatment greatly reduce risk of vision loss.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Acute ocular hypertension secondary to neovascular glaucoma (NVG) with elevated IOP due to anterior segment neovascularization; requires urgent IOP-lowering therapy, evaluation/treatment of underlying ischemic retinal cause (e.g., panretinal photocoagulation if view permits) and consideration of intravitreal anti-VEGF; likely need for glaucoma drainage device surgery if IOP not controlled medically.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute ocular hypertension secondary to neovascular glaucoma
Differential Diagnosis: Neovascular glaucoma (secondary to ischemic retinal disease, e.g., CRVO or proliferative diabetic retinopathy); Acute angle-closure glaucoma; Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis; Traumatic/angle-recession glaucoma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; topical beta-blockers; topical alpha-2 agonists; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; cholinergic agents (miotics); prostaglandin analogs; hyperosmotic agents; topical prednisolone; topical cycloplegics; intravitreal anti‑VEGF agent
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up with ophthalmology urgently for IOP control and treatment planning; arrange prompt panretinal photocoagulation if posterior view adequate or intravitreal anti‑VEGF injection once retinal detachment/tumor ruled out; monitor IOP, optic nerve status, visual fields, and OCT serially (at least every few weeks initially) and schedule glaucoma surgery (aqueous shunt) if IOP not controlled medically.
Patient Education: Explain that neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a secondary form of glaucoma caused by abnormal new blood vessels in the eye that can block fluid drainage and rapidly raise eye pressure, potentially damaging vision. Emphasize the need for prompt treatment to lower intraocular pressure (medications, sometimes oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and possibly urgent procedures) and to treat the underlying cause of ischemia (e.g., panretinal photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-VEGF injections). Describe common symptoms that should prompt immediate care (eye pain, redness, sudden vision change, headache, nausea/vomiting). Explain that medical therapy often controls pressure temporarily but surgical drainage devices are frequently required; if neovascularization is active, anti-VEGF may be given before surgery to reduce bleeding risk. Advise adherence to medications, follow-up appointments, and testing (IOP checks, optic nerve photos, visual fields, OCT). Discuss potential side effects/precautions for key treatments (oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors—watch renal function; hyperosmotics caution in diabetics/heart disease; possible transient vision changes after injections). Stress prevention: control systemic vascular disease (diabetes, hypertension), retina evaluation for ischemia, and regular eye exams if at risk. Provide guidance on pain management (topical steroids and cycloplegics, antiemetics for nausea) and explain prognosis: early detection and treatment improve chances of preserving vision, but advanced disease may require multiple interventions and may have guarded prognosis. Encourage immediate contact/emergency visit for severe pain or sudden vision loss.
Emergency Instructions: Lower intraocular pressure immediately and seek urgent ophthalmology care. If severe pain, vision loss, or nausea/vomiting occur, go to the emergency department. Do not take oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors if you have kidney disease or sickle cell disease without physician approval. Apply prescribed topical IOP-lowering drops as directed, use antiemetics if needed, and avoid heavy exertion. Urgent treatments may include oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, topical aqueous suppressants, topical steroids and cycloplegics for comfort, anterior chamber paracentesis if IOP is dangerously high, and intravitreal anti‑VEGF plus prompt retinal evaluation for panretinal photocoagulation or surgical drainage (tube shunt) as indicated. Seek immediate care if symptoms worsen or do not improve.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Herpes simplex anterior uveitis with secondary open‑angle inflammatory glaucoma of the right eye, presenting with marked corneal edema, hyphema, iris neovascularization, and a critically elevated IOP (67 mm Hg). Clinical picture most consistent with neovascular glaucoma secondary to prior ischemic CRVO, with associated inflammatory findings suggestive of herpetic iridocyclitis; left eye without acute findings (IOP 19 mm Hg) and notable for hypertensive retinopathy. Management priorities: control intraocular inflammation with topical/systemic corticosteroids and antiviral therapy as indicated, aggressive IOP lowering with aqueous suppressants and adjunctive agents, cycloplegia for comfort and synechiae prevention, and urgent consideration of surgical intervention (glaucoma drainage device or filtering surgery) if IOP remains uncontrolled, while treating underlying ischemic/neovascular drive (panretinal photocoagulation) when feasible. Close follow‑up with gonioscopy, optic nerve/visual field monitoring, and imaging as inflammation and corneal clarity permit.

All Procedures: gonioscopy slit-lamp examination ophthalmoscopy B-scan ultrasonography serologic workup body imaging topical corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%, rimexolone, loteprednol) topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (flurbiprofen, ketorolac, diclofenac) systemic immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate, azathioprine) topical aqueous suppressants (timolol, levobunolol) topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide, brinzolamide) topical adrenergic agonists (apraclonidine, dipivefrin) prostaglandin analog therapy (latanoprost) topical trifluridine oral acyclovir cycloplegic agents (atropine, cyclopentolate) laser peripheral iridotomy surgical iridectomy trabeculectomy with antimetabolite (5-fluorouracil or mitomycin C) aqueous drainage device implantation (Ahmed valve, Molteno implant) laser trabeculoplasty (contraindicated in active inflammation) laser cyclophotocoagulation
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequent follow-up with serial IOP checks, slit‑lamp and gonioscopic examinations to monitor inflammation, cornea, angle neovascularization/PAS; optic nerve evaluation and visual field testing to detect glaucomatous progression; adjust anti‑inflammatory and IOP medications as needed; monitor for complications (CME, band keratopathy); defer glaucoma surgery until inflammation controlled unless IOP dangerously elevated despite maximal medical therapy.
Patient Education: Your eye pain, redness, nausea, and very high eye pressure are caused by inflammation and abnormal new blood-vessel growth in the affected eye (neovascular/inflammatory glaucoma). Immediate goals are to lower the pressure to prevent optic nerve damage and to control the inflammation and any underlying eye disease. What to expect now - Urgent medical treatment to lower IOP (eye drops and possibly oral medication). You may have temporary blurry vision from corneal swelling. - Anti-inflammatory treatment (frequent steroid eye drops and possibly antiviral or other medications if infection is suspected). - Cycloplegic drops (e.g., atropine) to relieve pain and prevent synechiae. - Additional tests (gonioscopy, imaging, bloodwork) to find the cause of the inflammation and new vessels. - If medications do not control the pressure, laser or surgery (glaucoma drainage device or filtering surgery) may be recommended. Important warnings - Very high pressure can cause permanent vision loss; take medications exactly as prescribed and come to all follow-up visits. - If you develop worsening vision, severe eye pain, increasing headaches, nausea/vomiting, or new light sensitivity, seek care immediately. Self-care and follow-up - Keep scheduled ophthalmology appointments; frequent visits are often needed initially. - Avoid rubbing the eye. - Bring a list of all current medications and medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, vascular disease). - If prescribed topical steroids or antivirals, use them as directed and do not stop abruptly without instruction. Long-term issues - This condition may require ongoing monitoring and sometimes surgery; glaucoma can develop even after inflammation settles. - Control of systemic diseases (diabetes, hypertension) and treatment of the underlying cause of uveitis are important to reduce recurrence. If you have questions about your medications or what to expect with treatment, ask your ophthalmologist or clinic staff before you leave.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 38-year-old Caucasian man with a history of prior left-herpetic keratitis presented with 2 days of left eye blurry vision, photophobia, tearing, and pain. Exam shows OD 20/20, OS 20/60 improving to 20/40 with pinhole. IOPs: OD 12 mmHg, OS 46 mmHg. Left slit-lamp: fine stellate keratic precipitates, 2+ anterior chamber cells and flare, patchy iris pupillary sphincter atrophy on transillumination, deep anterior chamber, clear lens. Gonioscopy: angles open to ciliary band OU, moderate TM pigmentation and prominent iris processes, no PAS. Fundus: clear vitreous and symmetric healthy optic discs. Clinical picture consistent with unilateral herpetic anterior uveitis with secondary marked elevation of IOP (inflammatory glaucoma) in the left eye. Differential includes other causes of corneal haze and pediatric glaucomas in general discussion, but given history and findings, herpetic keratouveitis causing secondary glaucoma is most likely. Immediate management: lower IOP medically (topical/oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, careful beta‑blocker use) and initiate appropriate antiviral/anti-inflammatory therapy as indicated, with prompt ophthalmic follow-up and consideration of further intervention if IOP not controlled.

Fundus Exam – Periphery: Within normal limits


Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Hypotony due to primary overfiltration following filtration surgery, with associated maculopathy (disc swelling and chorioretinal folds). Initial medical measures including cycloplegia and topical therapy failed; autologous blood patch was ineffective. Surgical revision with placement of two additional scleral flap sutures restored IOP into the 20s, with subsequent suture lysis lowering IOP to 13 mm Hg and normalization of axial length, refraction, and visual acuity. Long-term IOP has remained in the low teens with no recurrent hypotony.
Primary Diagnosis: Hypotony due to primary overfiltration
Differential Diagnosis: Primary overfiltration; Hyposecretion of aqueous (underproduction); Bleb leak; Cyclodialysis cleft
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: aqueous suppressants, cycloplegic agents, topical corticosteroids, autologous blood
All Procedures: Seidel test; fundoscopy; gonioscopy; iCare IOP measurement; examination under anesthesia (pressure measurement, corneal diameter measurement, ultrasonography including axial length and biomicroscopy, anterior segment exam, gonioscopy, dilated fundus exam/optic disc photos); cycloplegic therapy; discontinuation of aqueous suppressants; topical corticosteroids; bandage contact lens; autologous blood patch; bleb compression sutures (external/mattress sutures); Nd:YAG laser bleb remodeling; resuturing of scleral flap via transconjunctival sutures or open bleb revision (dissection to bare sclera and direct scleral flap suturing); reformation of anterior chamber with viscoelastic; suture lysis
Follow-Up Instructions: Cycloplegic agents and conservative observation; if persistent, autologous blood patch (failed in this case) then surgical revision with additional scleral flap sutures; postoperative follow-up with IOP monitoring, axial length/refraction/visual acuity checks, and suture lysis as indicated (performed 1 month postrevision in this case)


CASE 27 — PosttrabeculectomyWound Leak
======================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: worsening vision
DURATION: 1 year
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "worsening vision"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 45-year-old woman with inflammatory glaucoma in the aphakic right eye referred for surgical management; preop vision 20/20 with aphakic correction, IOP 40 mm Hg on maximum medical therapy, 1+ AC cell/flare and fine KPs, vitreous at pupillary plane, cup-to-disc 0.9 with inferior notch and superior altitudinal field defect. Underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy; postoperative IOP 9–12 mm Hg for first year. One year after surgery developed worsening vision: VA decreased to 20/60 (improving to 20/20 with +1.50 D), highly elevated avascular cystic bleb, moderate chorioretinal folds at posterior pole and macula, IOP 3 mm Hg.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old woman was referred for surgical management of inflammatory glaucoma in her aphakic right eye. Her left eye had only light perception since birth due to persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. Preoperative visual acuity with aphakic correction was 20/20. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 40 mm Hg on maximum medical therapy including oral agents. Central corneal thickness was 535 μm in each eye. There was 1+ cell and flare in the anterior chamber with scattered, fine keratic precipitates. There was vitreous at the pupillary plane. The optic disc was markedly excavated with a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.9 and a notch inferiorly. The visual field had a superior altitudinal defect. A trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and subtotal vitrectomy was performed without incident. Postoperatively, visual acuity remained 20/20. IOP was well controlled in the range of 9 to 12 mm Hg for the first postoperative year. One year after surgery, the patient presented with worsening vision. Visual acuity was 20/60, which improved to 20/20 with an increase in hyperopic correction of +1.50 diopters. The bleb was highly elevated, avascular, and cystic. The remainder of the examination was unchanged from baseline except for moderate chorioretinal folds involving the posterior pole and macula. The IOP was 3 mm Hg.
Symptom Onset: 1 year after surgery
Symptom Duration: 1 year
Progression: Worsening vision over 1 year with development of late bleb leak and hypotony/maculopathy
Characteristics: Highly elevated, avascular, cystic bleb, Seidel-negative (late bleb leak), large and ischemic.

CASE 29 — Flat Anterior Chamber
===============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Flat anterior chamber
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: right eye
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 53‑year‑old African American woman with advanced primary open‑angle glaucoma (target IOP 15 mm Hg) who underwent a limbus‑based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye; at 1 year postop IOP was at target with a moderately elevated diffuse ischemic bleb with microcysts, and three months later she presented with IOP 28 mm Hg, a deep anterior chamber but an almost flat filtering bleb, later found to have central and peripheral shallowing of the anterior chamber with a patent peripheral iridectomy and no choroidal effusion or bleb leak, consistent with aqueous misdirection.
History Narrative: A 53-year-old African American woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma and a target IOP of 15 mm Hg underwent a limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in the right eye. At 1 year postop the IOP was at target with a moderately elevated diffuse ischemic bleb with microcysts. Three months later she presented with IOP of 28 mm Hg; the anterior chamber was flat; the filtering bleb was almost flat. There was a patent peripheral iridectomy, no bleb or wound leak, the eye was not hypotonous, and funduscopy and ultrasound demonstrated no choroidal elevation. The ciliary processes were easily visible through the iridectomy. Diagnosis: aqueous misdirection (ciliary block) of the right eye.
Symptom Onset: 3 months after the 1-year postoperative visit (i.e., 15 months after surgery)
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Progression: worsened over time, with initial IOP at target at 1 year, then 3 months later IOP elevated to 28 mm Hg with flat bleb, subsequently diagnosis of aqueous misdirection with progressive shallowing and possible further IOP elevation if untreated.
Characteristics: Aqueous misdirection (ciliary block/malignant glaucoma): central and peripheral anterior chamber shallowing with patent peripheral iridectomy, anterior rotation of ciliary body, no choroidal elevations, normal or elevated IOP, visible ciliary processes through iridectomy, occurs after intraocular surgery in eyes predisposed to angle closure.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Prior laser or incisional glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy with mitomycin C), short axial length/angle-closure–predisposed eye, discontinuation of cycloplegics, use of miotics, anterior rotation of ciliary body from hypotony/overfiltration or choroidal effusion
Alleviating Factors: Cycloplegics (e.g., atropine 1%) with phenylephrine, topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, oral/IV osmotic agents, intracameral viscoelastic injection, Nd:YAG or argon laser procedures (anterior hyaloid disruption or ciliary process shrinkage), and pars plana vitrectomy with anterior vitreous removal.
Associated Symptoms: Flat (very shallow) central and peripheral anterior chamber; elevated intraocular pressure (IOP 28 mm Hg); patent peripheral iridectomy; no iris bombé; no choroidal effusion or hemorrhage; visible ciliary processes through iridectomy; prior trabeculectomy with mitomycin C; failing/low flat bleb with microcysts earlier; possible vision pain not described explicitly.
Prior Treatments: limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C
Risk Factors: - Short axial length - Predisposition to angle-closure glaucoma (chronic angle-closure) - Prior laser or incisional intraocular surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy) - Phakic status (presence of lens) - Use of antimetabolites (e.g., mitomycin C) contributing to bleb changes - Discontinuation of cycloplegics - Eyes with prior filtration surgery and postoperative hypotony/overfiltration (as precursor)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Patent peripheral iridectomy present with uniform central and peripheral shallowing of the anterior chamber, no iris bombé, normal-to-elevated IOP (28 mm Hg), no bleb or wound leak, no hypotony, fundus and ultrasound without choroidal elevation, ciliary processes visible through the iridectomy. Findings most consistent with aqueous misdirection (ciliary block/malignant glaucoma).
Primary Diagnosis: Aqueous misdirection
Differential Diagnosis: Aqueous misdirection (ciliary block/malignant glaucoma); Overfiltration leading to hypotony with anterior rotation; Serous choroidal effusion; Pupillary block
Severity: Advanced
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Aqueous misdirection (malignant glaucoma) leading to a flat/very shallow anterior chamber with potential elevated IOP; possible need for laser or pars plana vitrectomy; risk of recurrence requiring long-term cycloplegia.


Plan
All Medications: Atropine 1% (cycloplegic–mydriatic) Phenylephrine 2.5% Topical aqueous suppressants (eg, beta-blocker or alpha agonist — unspecified) Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor Oral or intravenous osmotic agent Miotics (avoid) Intracameral viscoelastic (for anterior chamber reformation) Mitomycin C (intraoperative)
All Procedures: limbus-based trabeculectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C
Follow-Up Instructions: Maintain cycloplegia (e.g., atropine 1% daily) — may be indefinite; avoid miotics; monitor for recurrence (re-evaluate anterior chamber depth and IOP periodically); in fellow eye consider prophylactic laser iridotomy and avoid miotics; if vitrectomy performed, cycloplegia may be stopped with caution in phakic eyes.
Patient Education: You have a condition called aqueous misdirection (also called ciliary block or malignant glaucoma), which causes the front chamber of your eye to become very shallow and can raise eye pressure. It most often occurs after glaucoma surgery. Initial treatment is medical: eye drops to dilate and relax the eye (cycloplegics/mydriatics such as atropine), medications to reduce eye fluid production (topical aqueous suppressants and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), and sometimes an osmotic agent to reduce fluid in the back of the eye. Miotic drops (which constrict the pupil) should be avoided because they can make the problem worse. If medicines and laser treatments (YAG to open the anterior hyaloid or argon to shrink ciliary processes) do not help, a vitrectomy (surgical removal/disruption of vitreous) may be needed to restore normal fluid flow. You may need to continue dilating drops long-term to prevent recurrence. If you have symptoms such as increasing eye pain, vision loss, or a very shallow front chamber, seek urgent ophthalmic care. In the fellow eye, a preventive peripheral iridotomy and avoiding miotics are recommended if you need future eye surgery.


CASE 30 — Persistent Choroidal Detachment
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shallow anterior chamber and decreased vision in the right eye 1 day after trabeculectomy
DURATION: 1 day
LATERALITY: Right eye
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 53-year-old woman with bilateral chronic angle-closure glaucoma presented 1 day after a mitomycin trabeculectomy with a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye; she had decreased vision (20/400 OD, 20/40 OS), IOPs 34 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS, a moderately elevated filtration bleb negative for Seidel, central and peripheral anterior chamber shallowing with iridocorneal contact to within 1 mm of the pupil, central shallowing with a posterior chamber IOL 0.5 mm posterior to the endothelium, and 3+ anterior chamber cells; B-scan of the right eye showed a flat retina and no choroidal effusions.
History Narrative: A 53-year-old woman with a history of bilateral chronic angle-closure glaucoma presented 1 day after a mitomycin trabeculectomy in the right eye with a shallow anterior chamber. She reported visual decrease in the right eye; examination that day revealed right eye visual acuity 20/400 and left eye 20/40. Intraocular pressures were 34 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. She had a moderately elevated filtration bleb on the right that was Seidel-negative. The right anterior chamber was shallow centrally and peripherally with iridocorneal touch extending from the periphery to within 1 mm of the pupillary margin and a posterior chamber intraocular lens located 0.5 mm posterior to the corneal endothelium; anterior chamber cells were 3+. A surgical iridectomy was patent with ciliary processes visible. The left eye had a filtration bleb, deep anterior chamber, patent surgical iridectomy, and pseudophakia. Fundus exam of the right eye had a poor view but excellent red reflex; B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye showed a flat retina without choroidal effusions.
Symptom Onset: 1 day after trabeculectomy
Symptom Duration: 1 day
Progression: Persistent
Characteristics: Serous, smooth, orange/tan, bullous, typically four lobes, echolucent on B-scan


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: Observation; elevation of IOP; discontinuation of systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and topical aqueous suppressants in the affected eye; discontinuation of topical beta-blocker in the contralateral eye; topical steroid and cycloplegic therapy.

Prior Treatments: Mitomycin trabeculectomy
Impact on Daily Activities: Significant short-term impairment (visual axis blockage and profound visual loss when effusions are large) with generally full recovery after resolution or drainage; therefore temporary major impact on daily activities.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: Glaucoma filtration surgery (trabeculectomy with mitomycin), postoperative hypotony/overfiltration, prior chronic angle-closure glaucoma, pseudophakia (posterior chamber IOL), use of topical/systemic aqueous suppressants (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), recent tapering of steroids/iridocyclitis, bleb leak or thin ischemic bleb, surgical trauma (cyclodialysis cleft)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: Persistent serous choroidal detachment.
Primary Diagnosis: Persistent serous choroidal detachment
Secondary Diagnoses: Chronic angle-closure glaucoma (bilateral); Pseudophakia (right and left eyes)
Differential Diagnosis: Overfiltration/bleb leak; Serous choroidal effusion; Suprachoroidal hemorrhage; Retinal detachment
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye


Plan
All Medications: mitomycin (used during trabeculectomy), topical steroid, cycloplegic agent, topical beta-blocker (contralateral eye discontinued recommended), topical aqueous suppressants (discontinued recommended), systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (discontinued recommended; oral acetazolamide mentioned as sometimes used), balanced salt solution (BSS) or viscoelastic (used intraoperatively), subconjunctival antibiotics and steroids
All Procedures: mitomycin trabeculectomy; slit-lamp examination; B-scan ultrasonography; Seidel’s testing; gonioscopy; drainage of choroidal effusions (sclerostomy with suprachoroidal drainage)
Follow-Up Instructions: Examined 1 day postoperatively; place on a brief course of topical steroid, antibiotic, and cycloplegic (if phakic); monitor for persistent effusion/drainage and expect prompt resolution with dramatic visual recovery if visual axis was involved.
Patient Education: You have a serous choroidal detachment (fluid between the choroid and sclera) after glaucoma surgery. This commonly occurs with low eye pressure and is usually benign. Most cases improve with observation and conservative measures: stopping any medicines that lower eye pressure in the affected eye (and possibly in the fellow eye), using topical steroid and cycloplegic drops, and close monitoring. If vision is threatened (touching the lens/cornea or blocking the visual axis), or the detachment does not resolve, a simple surgical drainage can be performed with very good visual recovery. You will need frequent follow-up and possibly ultrasound exams to ensure the retina is flat and the fluid is resolving. Seek urgent care for sudden severe pain, a rapid drop in vision, or signs of infection.

Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in 4 to 6 weeks after anti‑VEGF (with or without focal laser); retreat if persistent edema/visual loss. Consider sequence of injections; switch agents if poor response after three consecutive injections at 4–6 week intervals. Intravitreal corticosteroid or repeat laser (3–6 months after initial) may be considered for persistent or severe edema. Close follow‑up for PRP decisions and systemic optimization.
Patient Education: Education about diabetic macular edema, including that anti-VEGF injections are now first-line for center-involving DME while laser remains an option for non–center-involving DME; importance of close follow-up (typically every 4–6 weeks after treatment) and that a series of 3 injections may be needed before changing therapy; counseling that optimal control of systemic conditions (blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol) improves outcomes; possible need to combine treatments (injections, focal/grid laser, or steroids) or switch drugs if response is inadequate; potential risks/benefits of focal/grid laser and that surgery is reserved for tractional cases; and that visual recovery may be limited despite multiple treatments, so setting realistic expectations.
Referrals: Medical consultation for optimization of systemic conditions (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, glycemic control)

Key points: - This is a sight‑threatening complication of long‑standing diabetes; good control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol is essential to slow progression. - Treatments aim to prevent further vision loss: panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP) is the standard for proliferative disease; intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are effective for macular edema and can help regress neovascularization. - PRP may require multiple sessions, can cause temporary pain and decreased night vision, and may worsen macular edema temporarily; combining or giving anti‑VEGF beforehand can reduce this risk. - Anti‑VEGF injections are usually given monthly initially and may be repeated based on OCT and symptoms; expect follow‑up OCT to monitor macular thickness. - Watch for sudden vision decrease or new floaters/hemorrhage — these may signal vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment and require urgent evaluation. - Regular dilated retinal exams and OCT are required; adherence to follow‑up visits and treatment is critical to preserve vision. - Maintain coordination with your primary care/endocrinologist for tight systemic control and with your ophthalmologist to plan PRP, injections, or possible vitrectomy if bleeding or traction develops.


CASE 34 — Retinal Arterial Occlusion
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Second opinion regarding possibility of diabetic retinopathy; asymptomatic on presentation
LATERALITY: right
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 50-year-old man with a 5-year history of type II diabetes mellitus presented for a second opinion regarding possibility of diabetic retinopathy; asymptomatic on initial presentation.
History Narrative: A 50-year-old man with a 5-year history of type II diabetes mellitus presented for a second opinion regarding possible diabetic retinopathy. He was asymptomatic on presentation.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Branch retinal artery occlusion, right eye — acute retinal arterial ischemia with retinal whitening and Hollenhorst plaque in the inferotemporal distribution, limited filling of the affected inferotemporal retinal artery on fluorescein angiography; visual prognosis better than CRAO with many eyes improving to ≥20/40, but patient requires systemic vascular workup (atherosclerosis/carotid disease, cardiac evaluation) and close follow-up for neovascularization, with consideration of acute maneuvers to dislodge embolus if within 24 hours and panretinal photocoagulation if neovascularization develops.
Primary Diagnosis: Branch retinal artery occlusion
Secondary Diagnoses: Type II diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Central retinal artery occlusion; Branch retinal artery occlusion; Retinal vein occlusion (ischemic branch/central); Giant cell arteritis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Neovascularization (retinal and disc), iris neovascularization/rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, retinal atrophy with permanent visual field defect, increased risk of stroke/MI (systemic vascular events)


Plan
All Medications: acetazolamide
All Procedures: digital ocular massage; lowering intraocular pressure (IV acetazolamide, topical IOP-lowering drops, or anterior chamber paracentesis); inhalation of carbogen (5% CO2/95% O2); retrobulbar or systemic calcium channel blockers; full-scatter panretinal photocoagulation; fluorescein angiography; spectral-domain optical coherence tomography; stereoscopic fundus photography; slit-lamp biomicroscopy with precorneal or contact lens examination
Follow-Up Instructions: Monitor for subsequent neovascularization; reinforce internist-prescribed systemic regimens; consider low-vision aids/prism glasses as needed.
Patient Education: Retinal arterial occlusion is a sudden blockage of an artery in the eye that can cause sudden, often permanent vision loss; it is important because it may signal serious systemic vascular disease (like atherosclerosis, carotid plaque, or heart rhythm problems) and requires prompt medical evaluation. There is no proven ocular treatment to restore vision, but early measures (digital ocular massage, lowering intraocular pressure, or paracentesis when within 24 hours) are sometimes attempted. You should be referred promptly for systemic workup by your primary care doctor or cardiologist (carotid imaging, cardiac rhythm evaluation, vascular risk factor control—blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, smoking cessation). Follow-up eye exams are important to monitor for neovascularization, which may require panretinal photocoagulation. Seek immediate care for any new sudden vision changes.
Referrals: Referral for systemic medical workup (internist/cardiovascular evaluation for atherosclerosis, carotid plaque assessment, and arrhythmia evaluation)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: CRVO OD with secondary macular edema causing visual loss. 69-year-old woman with 4 weeks of sudden right-eye visual loss; exam shows intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants, tortuous veins, no afferent pupillary defect, IOP 16 mm Hg OU, early nuclear sclerosis OU. OCT confirms marked intraretinal/macular edema OD. Risk factors: hypertension and diabetes; oral contraceptive use noted previously and cessation recommended. Plan: systemic evaluation/management with primary physician, consider aspirin, monitor for ischemic conversion and neovascularization; initiate intravitreal anti-VEGF or corticosteroid therapy for macular edema with OCT-guided retreatment and monthly follow-up for at least 6 months; consider PRP if ≥5 disc areas of nonperfusion or rubeosis develops; treat neovascular glaucoma with anti-VEGF, PRP, and glaucoma surgery/shunt if needed.
Primary Diagnosis: CRVO with secondary macular edema, OD
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; diabetes mellitus; early nuclear sclerosis of the lens; history of oral contraceptive use; Hollenhorst plaque (cholesterol embolus)
Differential Diagnosis: Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO); Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)/hemiretinal vein occlusion; Diffuse diabetic retinopathy (or radiation retinopathy) with widespread intraretinal hemorrhage
Severity: Moderate (CRVO with secondary macular edema)
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: - Neovascularization of the anterior segment (rubeosis iridis) leading to neovascular glaucoma - Macular edema - Vitreous hemorrhage - Increased intraocular pressure/glaucoma (including neovascular glaucoma) - Vision loss (ranging from mild to severe; potential permanent visual impairment) - Retinal ischemia/nonperfusion - Collateral vessel formation at the optic disc - Need for vitrectomy or glaucoma/shunt surgery in advanced cases


Plan
All Medications: Aspirin 80 mg daily; intravitreal anti-VEGF injections; intravitreal triamcinolone (corticosteroid); cessation of oral contraceptives
All Procedures: Cessation of oral contraceptives; referral to primary care for systemic evaluation; monthly ophthalmic follow-up for 6 months; panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) if ≥5 disc areas of nonperfusion or rubeosis iridis; intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for macular edema; intravitreal corticosteroid injection (triamcinolone) for macular edema; pars plana vitrectomy or cryopexy if media opacity prevents laser; glaucoma shunt surgery for neovascular glaucoma; grid photocoagulation (not efficacious for macular edema)
Follow-Up Instructions: Monthly follow-up examinations for 6 months after diagnosis (if injection therapy not given); continued monitoring thereafter with attention to any decrease in visual acuity or conversion to nonperfused CRVO (rubeosis risk declines after 1 year).
Patient Education: You have a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), which is a blockage of the main retinal vein causing swelling and bleeding in the retina. This can reduce vision mainly from macular edema (swelling in the central retina) and, in severe ischemic cases, can lead to abnormal new blood vessel growth (rubeosis) and neovascular glaucoma. Important points and actions: - Systemic risks: CRVO is commonly associated with hypertension, diabetes, and in younger patients hormonal contraceptives or clotting disorders. You should follow up with your primary doctor for blood pressure, diabetes control, and evaluation of any other clotting risk factors; stopping oral contraceptives was recommended. - Vision treatment: Macular edema is often treatable and commonly managed with repeated intravitreal injections (anti-VEGF or corticosteroid) guided by OCT imaging; this can improve or stabilize vision in many patients. - Glaucoma risk: If the retina is severely ischemic, abnormal vessels can develop 3–6 months after onset and may cause painful high eye pressure; close ophthalmic follow-up (monthly for the first 6 months) is important to detect rubeosis early so laser (panretinal photocoagulation) and/or anti-VEGF and glaucoma surgery can be done if needed. - Monitoring: Expect regular eye exams and OCT scans; report any sudden worsening of vision, eye pain, redness, or new floaters immediately. - Prognosis: Visual outcome varies—some improvement is possible with treatment of macular edema, but outcomes depend on the degree of retinal ischemia. - Lifestyle/medication: Control blood pressure and diabetes, discuss antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy with your physicians as appropriate, and avoid smoking.


CASE 36 — Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion
=======================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision in the right eye for 3 weeks
DURATION: 3 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I've had decreased vision in my right eye for three weeks."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 45-year-old woman with a 3-week history of decreased vision in the right eye; vision gradually diminished during the first week after onset then stabilized. No hypertension; taking oral contraceptives. Prior pseudophakia OD. Presented with BCVA 20/100 OD and 20/20 OS, right afferent pupillary defect, macular edema involving the fovea, and intraretinal hemorrhages in segmental distribution.
History Narrative: A 45-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of decreased vision in the right eye. Her only medications were oral contraceptives and she did not have hypertension. The vision had gradually diminished during the first week after onset and then stabilized. Examination disclosed best corrected visual acuity of 20/100 OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination showed no signs of iris neovascularization; the patient was pseudophakic with a clear posterior capsule. Intraocular pressures were 12 and 14 mm Hg, respectively. Funduscopic examination on the right showed intraretinal hemorrhage distributed throughout each quadrant with mild disc edema, but no definite collaterals. Macular edema was evident over about a disc area at the fovea. The cup-to-disc ratio was 0.3. Examination of the left eye was normal. Fluorescein angiography showed good perfusion in the midperiphery and late dye leakage at the fovea. OCT showed marked central macular edema. Intravitreal triamcinolone was administered with resolution of the macular edema and improvement of vision to 20/30 at 3 months. Edema and visual loss recurred at 6 months; a second intravitreal triamcinolone produced similar resolution but recurred 3 months later. The patient has been maintained on intravitreal bevacizumab about every 3 months with a stable OCT and visual acuity of 20/30.
Symptom Onset: 3-week history
Symptom Duration: 3 weeks
Progression: Recurrent with periods of resolution (chronic recurrent course)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: BRVO of the right eye with foveal-involving macular edema causing decreased vision (initial BCVA 20/100 OD), chronic recurrent edema responsive to intravitreal triamcinolone and maintained on serial intravitreal anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) with stabilized OCT and vision of 20/30 OD; no iris neovascularization or vitreous hemorrhage; IOPs 12–14 mm Hg; fellow eye normal.
Primary Diagnosis: BRVO with macular edema, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Pseudophakia OD; History of oral contraceptive use; No hypertension; Right afferent pupillary defect; Macular edema OD; Intraretinal hemorrhages OD; Mild optic disc edema OD; Prior intravitreal triamcinolone OD; Ongoing intravitreal bevacizumab treatment OD
Differential Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy; Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO); Radiation retinopathy; Sickle cell retinopathy
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: Macular edema; intraretinal hemorrhage; disc edema; retinal neovascularization (possible but not present initially); vitreous hemorrhage (possible with neovascularization); recurrence of edema after treatment; potential epiretinal membrane; vision loss.


Plan
All Medications: oral contraceptives; intravitreal triamcinolone; intravitreal bevacizumab; intravitreal aflibercept; aspirin
All Procedures: intravitreal triamcinolone injection; intravitreal bevacizumab injections; focal/grid laser photocoagulation; sectoral/scatter laser photocoagulation; vitrectomy with membrane peeling; vitrectomy for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage; optic nerve sheath decompression (experimental); lysis/decompression of common adventitial sheath (experimental)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up every 3–6 months initially if vision >20/32; if being treated for macular edema, initiate intravitreal therapy (typically every 4–6 weeks) and then extend interval based on OCT/clinical response; perform segmental scatter photocoagulation if retinal neovascularization develops; consider vitrectomy for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage or tractional/rhegmatogenous macular detachment.
Patient Education: You have a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), which means one of the small veins that drains your retina is blocked. This can cause blood and fluid to leak into the retina and produce swelling of the macula (macular edema), which is why your vision dropped. Key points: - Cause and risk factors: BRVO often occurs spontaneously but is more common with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, and other vascular risk factors. Because you are younger, your doctor may advise targeted systemic evaluation and will notify your primary care physician. - Symptoms to watch for: worsening blurry or distorted central vision, new floaters, sudden loss of vision, or increasing pain (seek urgent care if these occur). - Treatment overview: Macular edema is commonly treated with intravitreal medicines (anti‑VEGF injections or corticosteroid injections) to reduce swelling and improve or stabilize vision; focal or sectoral laser is used in some cases, and scatter laser is used if abnormal new vessels (neovascularization) develop. Surgery (vitrectomy) is reserved for persistent nonclearing hemorrhage or tractional problems. - What to expect: Multiple injections may be needed initially (often every 4–12 weeks) and then less frequently when stable. OCT scans and periodic eye exams monitor response. Vision may improve but can recur, requiring additional treatment. - Systemic care: Control blood pressure, lipids, blood sugar, and stop smoking; follow up with your primary care doctor for risk-factor management. - Follow-up schedule: Regular ophthalmology visits (initially every 4–12 weeks while receiving injections, then every 3–6 months when stable) and prompt return for any sudden vision changes. If you have questions about the treatments, risks, or need help coordinating systemic evaluation, ask your ophthalmologist.
Referrals: Notify patient's primary care physician.


CASE 37 — Nonexudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration
=======================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased vision OS with a central scotoma for 2 months
DURATION: 2 months
LATERALITY: OU
PATIENT QUOTES: "he reported was well controlled on medications"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 66-year-old man with a 2-month history of decreased vision in the left eye characterized by a central scotoma centered superotemporally; history notable for long-standing hypertension well controlled on medications.
History Narrative: A 66-year-old man had a 2-month history of decreased vision OS characterized by a central scotoma that was centered superatemporally. He had a 20-year history of hypertension that he reported was well controlled on medications. The visual acuity was 20/200 at first presentation, OS. A branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) was diagnosed. The right eye had previously incurred a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) that responded to several injections of several anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, as well as a couple of intravitreal triamcinolone injections. The visual acuity OD had improved from 20/400 to 20/80 after resolution of the macular edema. Intravitreal bevacizumab was administered without improvement, followed by aflibercept which had a better effect and has been applied for about a year every 6 weeks. The visual acuity has stabilized at 20/70. The intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg in each eye. Funduscopic examination OD showed a dry macula with collateral vessels at the optic nerve head. In the left eye, there was an anomalous arteriovenous crossing along the inferotemporal arcade with dot-and-blot hemorrhages extending from the midportion of the inferotemporal arcade posteriorly into the macula. There was moderate to marked macular edema.
Symptom Onset: 2 months
Symptom Duration: 2 months
Progression: Stable (no progression noted over follow-up; vision stabilized at 20/70 OS with ongoing monitoring recommended)
Characteristics: Nonexudative (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration characterized by drusen with variable RPE atrophy, no exudation on FA/OCT, possible geographic atrophy, bilateral (OU) involvement.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Nonexudative (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration, OU — characterized by drusen with variable RPE atrophy of the macula. No evidence of exudation or choroidal neovascularization on imaging (OCT and fluorescein angiography). Visual function reduced (history of central scotoma OS; prior CRVO OD with residual visual deficit), but retinal thickness is thin with preservation of remaining retinal structure suggesting relatively spared photoreceptors. Recommend AREDS2 vitamin supplementation, smoking avoidance, routine monitoring every 3–12 months, patient education on Amsler grid and prompt return for any increase in metamorphopsia or new visual symptoms; consider low-vision referral if functional impairment progresses.
Primary Diagnosis: Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration, OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Branch retinal vein occlusion; Central retinal vein occlusion; Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Occult exudative (neovascular) AMD; Pattern dystrophy (or inherited macular dystrophy, e.g., Stargardt); Inflammatory- or trauma-induced RPE atrophy; Optic neuropathy or amblyopia (coexisting causes of disproportionate vision loss)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OU
Complications: development of exudative (neovascular) AMD


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab, aflibercept, intravitreal triamcinolone, AREDS2 vitamins, antihypertensive medications (for hypertension)
Follow-Up Instructions: Examine every 3–12 months depending on stability; use Amsler grid daily to monitor each eye and report any new or increased metamorphopsia or other visual changes immediately.
Patient Education: Use AREDS2 vitamin supplements, avoid tobacco smoking, perform daily Amsler grid self-monitoring for each eye, report any new visual changes (especially increased metamorphopsia) immediately, and consider low-vision evaluation/ aids as needed; follow-up every 3–12 months depending on stability.
Referrals: Low vision evaluation
Emergency Instructions: Any sudden change in vision—especially new or worsening metamorphopsia, sudden increase in central scotoma, new floaters, flashes, or marked vision loss—promptly return for immediate evaluation for possible exudative (neovascular) conversion.


CASE 38 — Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration
====================================================

CASE 39 — Myopic Degeneration
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: decreased vision in her right eye
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "decreased vision in my right eye"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 87-year-old woman with prior nonexudative AMD in both eyes presenting with decreased vision in the right eye; exam showed VA 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS, no RAPD, pseudophakia OU, normal IOPs; fundus OD with drusen, RPE changes, new subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment without hemorrhage; OCT confirmed PED with adjacent subretinal fluid OD and drusen without fluid OS; FA OD showed delayed stippled hyperfluorescence with late leakage consistent with occult CNVM; underwent intravitreal bevacizumab and instructed to follow up in 4 weeks.
History Narrative: An 87-year-old woman presented complaining of decreased vision in her right eye. She had a prior history of nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in both eyes. Examination showed vision of 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. There was no definite afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination showed the patient to be pseudophakic in both eyes. Intraocular pressures were within normal limits in each eye. Funduscopic examination on the right showed drusen with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes in the macula with new subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment. No hemorrhage was noted. On the left, there were drusen with RPE changes in the macula but no hemorrhage was noted. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the right eye showed a pigment epithelial detachment with adjacent subretinal fluid; the left eye showed drusen with no evidence of macular fluid. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed delayed stippled hyperfluorescence with late leakage, consistent with an occult choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM). The patient underwent an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and was instructed to follow up in 4 weeks.
Symptom Duration: 4 weeks
Characteristics: Myopic degeneration characterized by atrophic versus neovascular forms, often with lacquer cracks, posterior staphyloma, peripapillary RPE atrophy, drusen-like RPE changes, retinal lattice degeneration, pigment epithelial detachments, subretinal fluid/CNV (often occult or subfoveal), and Fuchs’ spot in late stages

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization with recurrence secondary to myopic degeneration, OU, with active occult CNVM in the right eye manifesting as pigment epithelial detachment and adjacent subretinal fluid on OCT and late leakage on FA; left eye myopic degenerative changes with lacquer crack and focal CNVM changes nasally but without significant macular fluid.
Primary Diagnosis: Subretinal choroidal neovascularization secondary to myopic degeneration, OU
Secondary Diagnoses: Age-related macular degeneration (nonexudative) OU; pseudophakia OU; retinal lattice degeneration OD; high myopia (−10 D)
Differential Diagnosis: Pathologic myopia with choroidal neovascularization; Age-related macular degeneration with CNV; Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome with CNV; Traumatic choroidal rupture with secondary CNV
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OU
Complications: - Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment - Subfoveal scarring/Fuchs' spot - Progressive RPE and chorioretinal atrophy leading to central vision loss - Retinal detachment (associated with lattice degeneration and posterior staphyloma) - Lacquer cracks (breaks in Bruch’s membrane)


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab
All Procedures: Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab; optical coherence tomography; fluorescein angiography; photodynamic therapy with verteporfin; laser photocoagulation; pars plana vitrectomy with CNVM excision; Amsler grid monitoring; OCT at each follow-up
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in 4 weeks for clinical exam and OCT; thereafter interval may be extended based on response and stability, with OCT at each visit and prompt return for new distortion or vision loss (use Amsler grid monitoring).
Patient Education: - Myopic degeneration can cause central vision loss; monitor for new distortion or decreased central vision and report promptly. - Use an Amsler grid daily to check for metamorphopsia or scotomas and bring any changes to your ophthalmologist immediately. - Follow-up visits are typically every 4 weeks after starting anti-VEGF treatment, then less frequently based on response; OCT will be performed at visits to monitor for fluid. - Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (e.g., bevacizumab, ranibizumab) are the main treatment for neovascular complications and can stabilize or improve vision; discuss risks and benefits with your doctor. - There is no proven treatment for atrophic (nonexudative) myopic degeneration; low-vision aids (magnifiers, high‑plus lenses, telescopes, video magnification) and rehabilitation can help maximize remaining vision. - Report signs of possible complications of injections (increasing pain, redness, marked vision loss) immediately as they may indicate infection or retinal detachment.

Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 1-month history of distortion with a paracentral scotoma in the left eye
DURATION: 1 month
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "finding everything to be cloudy."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 38-year-old urologist with a 1-year history of visual loss in the right eye; told previously he had a CNVM not amenable to treatment.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Central serous chorioretinopathy of the left eye with subfoveal subretinal fluid on OCT and focal fluorescein leakage; chronicity noted with recurrent symptoms beyond typical spontaneous-resolution window. Right eye with chronic RPE atrophy and prior/presumed inactive CNVM with longstanding reduced vision (20/200). No signs of intraocular inflammation. Risk factors/considerations: male gender, stress/type A, possible steroid exposure; monitor for recurrence and consider focal laser or photodynamic therapy for persistent/recurrent subretinal fluid.
Primary Diagnosis: Central serous chorioretinopathy
Secondary Diagnoses: Myopia (high myopia), Glaucoma, Retinal lattice degeneration, Choroidal neovascular membrane (right and left)
Differential Diagnosis: Central serous chorioretinopathy; Choroidal neovascular membrane (eg, myopic CNV or AMD-related CNV); Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease (or other posterior inflammatory chorioretinopathies); Choroidal tumor (eg, melanoma)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left eye
Complications: scotomas; pigment epithelial mottling/atrophy; chronic subretinal fluid with persistent visual acuity loss; recurrences; secondary choroidal neovascularization


Plan
All Medications: Propine (dipivefrin) OU; topical beta‑blocker OU; oral rifampin; methotrexate; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; metoprolol; propranolol; ketoconazole; mifepristone; eplerenone; spironolactone; finasteride; anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) injections
All Procedures: argon blue-green laser treatment OU (left eye treated) krypton laser treatment (left eye)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for monitoring until resolution within ~3 months; arrange serial visits with visual acuity, fundus exam and OCT to document subretinal fluid resolution; consider follow-up every 4–6 weeks initially; if persistent/chronic or recurrent, consider photodynamic therapy or focal laser and refer for treatment planning.
Patient Education: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a usually self‑limited condition in which fluid collects under the central retina, causing blurred or distorted vision. Risk factors include corticosteroid use, stress/type A personality, pregnancy, hypertension, and certain medications. Most cases improve spontaneously within 3 months; avoid or discuss stopping systemic steroids with your prescribing physician. If fluid persists or vision is functionally significant, treatments that may be offered include focal laser or photodynamic therapy (PDT) to help resolve subretinal fluid. Regular follow‑up with retinal imaging (OCT and possibly fluorescein/ICG angiography) is recommended to monitor resolution or recurrence. Report any new or worsening central vision changes promptly.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Blurriness in left eye for 3 weeks
DURATION: 3 weeks
LATERALITY: Right eye
PATIENT QUOTES: "I deny any past medical history, trauma, diabetes, hypertension, steroids, or previous surgeries."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 35-year-old engineer with 3-week history of blurriness in the left eye, central metamorphopsia on Amsler grid, no trauma, no past medical history, diabetes, hypertension, steroids, or prior surgeries. Visual acuity 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS (improving to 20/30 with +2.00), anterior segment and IOP unremarkable, dilated fundus: left circumscribed neurosensory macular detachment; OCT showed subretinal fluid under the fovea; FA showed expanding macular leakage. Observed with spontaneous resolution of subretinal fluid and vision returned to 20/20 after one month.
History Narrative: A 35-year-old engineer presented with blurriness in his left eye for 3 weeks. He denies any past medical history, trauma, diabetes, hypertension, steroids, or previous surgeries. On examination, the visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. With a +2.00 lens, the vision in the left eye improved to 20/30. Anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were unremarkable in both eyes. A dilated fundus examination of the right eye was normal. The left eye had an elevated, circumscribed neurosensory detachment of the retina. There were no retinal tears, hemorrhages, or exudates. The patient noted central metamorphopsia on Amsler grid testing of his left eye. On optical coherence tomography (OCT), there was subretinal fluid under the fovea in the left eye. Fluorescein angiography (FA) of the left eye revealed an expanding area of leakage in the macula. The patient was observed closely. One month later, the subretinal fluid completely resolved, and the vision returned to 20/20.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: ERM secondary to previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment, right eye. Patient presenting with decreased vision and metamorphopsia; OCT and clinical exam consistent with an epiretinal membrane causing foveal distortion and retinal thickening. Surgical removal via vitrectomy and ERM peel performed; postoperative course with improved foveal contour and decreased thickness on OCT and visual acuity improvement by 3 months.
Primary Diagnosis: ERM secondary to previous peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment, right eye
Secondary Diagnoses: Peripheral retinal break and retinal detachment (right eye)
Differential Diagnosis: Cystoid macular edema; Vitreomacular traction; Hypotony-related retinal folds
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: retinal detachment; progressive nuclear sclerosis (accelerated cataract formation)


Plan
All Medications: Topical corticosteroid drops; topical antibiotic drops
All Procedures: Vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel (with internal limiting membrane peel as performed)
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative topical corticosteroid and antibiotic drops; routine follow-up visits with visual acuity and OCT at ~1 week, 6 weeks, and 3 months (visual recovery usually rapid over first 6 weeks and maximal by 3–6 months); monitor for complications (retinal detachment, cataract progression) and treat cataract if needed.
Patient Education: Epiretinal membranes (macular pucker) are a common cause of visual distortion (metamorphopsia) and mild vision loss. They are diagnosed by clinical exam and OCT. If vision and symptoms are minimal, observation is reasonable because many membranes stabilize and may not worsen. If vision declines to about 20/40–20/60 or distortion is disabling, pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peel (often with internal limiting membrane removal) can improve anatomy and symptoms over months; recovery is fastest in the first 6 weeks and may continue up to 3–6 months. Postoperative care includes topical steroid and antibiotic drops. Risks of surgery are low but include retinal detachment and a high likelihood of cataract progression in phakic eyes. If you notice sudden worsening, new flashes, showers of floaters, or increased distortion, contact your ophthalmologist promptly.

CASE 43 — Vitreous Hemorrhage
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye for 3 months, interfering with driving and reading
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 78-year-old woman with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye, interfering with driving and reading; vision 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS.
History Narrative: A 78-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of progressively worsening blurred vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye interfering with driving and reading abilities. The vision was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated clear cornea, absence of cataract, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Fundoscopic examination showed focal areas of adherent posterior vitreous to the macula associated with raised retinal tissue, OD, and a nonspecific loss of foveal reflex, OS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in OD demonstrated a hyperreflective layer correspondent to the posterior hyaloid partially attached to the macula, leading to elevation and distortion of the retina. The OCT OS also showed focal vitreomacular attachment with distortion of the inner foveal layers. An intravitreal ocriplasmin injection was performed OD, without improvement in vision or OCT appearance after 1 month. A pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed OD with release of the vitreomacular traction (VMT) and improvement of the foveal contour. The vision was 20/30 OD 1 month postoperatively. The OS has remained unchanged with vision of 20/40 without clinically important or progressive symptoms, so it has been observed.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Vitreous hemorrhage of the left eye due to breakthrough bleeding from choroidal neovascularization associated with wet age-related macular degeneration. Visual potential limited (20/200) with good fellow-eye vision; continued observation recommended with consideration of vitrectomy only if bilateral visual decline or nonclearing hemorrhage.
Primary Diagnosis: Vitreous hemorrhage due to breakthrough bleeding associated with choroidal neovascularization, OS
Secondary Diagnoses: Choroidal neovascularization (wet age-related macular degeneration)
Differential Diagnosis: Breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage from choroidal neovascularization (wet AMD); Posterior vitreous detachment with retinal tear; Proliferative retinopathy (eg, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or vein occlusion); Vitreous opacities from posterior uveitis (pars planitis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS


Plan
All Medications: ocriplasmin
All Procedures: intravitreal ocriplasmin injection OD pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) OD
Follow-Up Instructions: Close clinical follow-up with repeated fundus exams and B‑scan ultrasound as needed; observe for spontaneous clearing for 3–6 months (unless signs of retinal tear/detachment or nonclearing hemorrhage warrant earlier vitrectomy); consider vitrectomy if no clearing by 3–6 months or sooner if retinal tear, detachment, or other indications; counsel patient about limited visual potential and ensure good fellow‑eye function.
Patient Education: You have a vitreous hemorrhage—blood inside the gel of the eye—most likely from bleeding related to your macular (choroidal neovascular) disease. This can cause blurry vision and distortion. Important points: - Immediate threats to vision include retinal tears or detachment; these are diagnosed with dilated exam and B‑scan ultrasound when the view is limited. - In many cases we observe closely because blood can clear on its own; if it does not clear or if there is an underlying treatable cause, vitrectomy (surgical removal of the vitreous) may be recommended after weeks to months depending on cause and visual potential. - If the hemorrhage is due to neovascular macular degeneration, treatment focuses on controlling the underlying neovascularization (often with injections or laser when appropriate), but visual recovery may be limited. - Positioning (sleeping slightly upright) can help the blood settle inferiorly to improve examination but does not speed clearance. - Seek prompt care for sudden worsening, new flashes, increased floaters, or a curtain/shadow—these may indicate a retinal tear or detachment requiring urgent treatment. - Follow-up with scheduled exams and imaging (OCT and/or B‑scan) is essential to monitor clearing and detect treatable complications.


CASE 44 — Retinitis Pigmentosa
==============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: sudden decreased vision in the left eye for 3 months
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 90-year-old woman with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye; prior vision 3 years earlier was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS from atrophic AMD OD and previously treated subfoveal CNV OS; currently VA 20/40 OD and 2/200 OS, IOP 12 mm Hg OU; slit-lamp: right posterior chamber IOL well positioned with vitreous adherent to superior wound; left eye 2+ nuclear sclerosis and dense vitreous hemorrhage precluding posterior view; B-scan showed vitreous hemorrhage with PVD OS, no retinal tear or detachment. She was observed without treatment for 3 months, during which vision improved to 20/400 and a subfoveal laser scar with contiguous subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the midperiphery became visible. No history of diabetes or hypertension.
History Narrative: This 90-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of sudden decreased vision in the left eye. She had prior vision of 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS three years earlier from atrophic age-related macular degeneration OD and a previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane OS. Medical history negative for diabetes and hypertension. On presentation visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 2/200 OS; intraocular pressures 12 mm Hg OU. Slit-lamp exam showed a well-positioned posterior chamber lens implant OD with vitreous adherent to the superior wound; OS had 2+ nuclear sclerosis and a very dense vitreous hemorrhage precluding posterior view. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated vitreous hemorrhage with posterior vitreous detachment OS, no retinal tear or detachment, and an indeterminate left macular disciform scar. She was observed without treatment for 3 months; on follow-up VA improved to 20/400 and exam revealed a subfoveal laser scar with contiguous subretinal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the midperiphery.
Symptom Onset: between the second and fifth decades of life
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: moderately advanced
Characteristics: Progressive rod and cone photoreceptor dysfunction and death with midperipheral retinal atrophy, pigmentary clumping ("bone spicules"), vascular attenuation, nyctalopia and progressive peripheral vision loss, often with preserved central vision until late stages


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Exposure to bright/ultraviolet sunlight
Alleviating Factors: Observation/monitoring; treatment of cataract or cystoid macular edema if present; sunglasses (reduce UV exposure); possible oral supplements (vitamin A palmitate, DHA, lutein) and low-vision aids; retinal implant for very advanced disease
Associated Symptoms: Gradual progressive nyctalopia and progressive loss of peripheral vision
Prior Treatments: Previously treated subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane OS; cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens OD.
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — progressive peripheral vision loss and nyctalopia impair mobility and night activities but central vision relatively spared until late, allowing many daily tasks with limitations.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Risk Factors: Age (typically onset 2nd–5th decades) — family history/genetic inheritance (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked); approximately 50% sporadic cases; multiple causative genes (>150); posterior subcapsular cataract; prior ocular surgery/trauma not specified; no diabetes or hypertension.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 26-year-old healthy Caucasian man with a 1-week history of bilateral decreased vision and scotomas following recent febrile illness, exam notable for normal anterior segment and no vitritis but multiple flat, deep, creamy placoid lesions in the posterior poles bilaterally. Multimodal imaging (FA: early hypofluorescence with late staining; ICG: corresponding hypofluorescent areas; OCT: outer retinal hyperreflectivity, disruption of photoreceptor outer segments and RPE abnormalities) is characteristic of severe bilateral choroiditis consistent with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome. Differential includes APMPPE, serpiginous choroiditis, MEWDS, and other white-dot syndromes, but the bilateral placoid lesions, imaging pattern, lack of anterior/vitreous inflammation, and prodromal systemic symptoms support VKH as the leading diagnosis. Recommend prompt initiation of high-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy and close follow-up for monitoring response and potential need for steroid-sparing immunosuppression.
Primary Diagnosis: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome
Differential Diagnosis: APMPPE; Serpiginous choroiditis; MEWDS; VKH syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: posterior synechiae; angle-closure glaucoma; choroidal neovascularization; cataract; exudative retinal detachments


Plan
All Medications: prednisone (oral systemic corticosteroids 80–200 mg/day; may use IV steroids in severe cases), prednisolone acetate 1% (topical), cycloplegic agent, ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, azathioprine
All Procedures: fluorescein angiography indocyanine green angiography optical coherence tomography anterior chamber paracentesis intravenous steroid therapy systemic corticosteroid therapy (oral prednisone) topical prednisolone acetate 1% cycloplegic agent administration of H2‑blocker (ranitidine) immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, azathioprine) cataract surgery (if indicated) surgical intervention for angle‑closure glaucoma (if indicated) surgical treatment for choroidal neovascularization (if indicated)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow frequently in the initial stages to adjust corticosteroid treatment and prevent sequelae; after inflammation and exudative detachment decrease, examine less frequently and taper systemic steroids gradually (slow taper over ~4–6 months, up to 6 months after complete resolution); if steroids inadequate or not tolerated, consider systemic immunosuppressants; monitor regularly for cataract, choroidal neovascularization, and angle‑closure glaucoma.
Patient Education: Explain the diagnosis (Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome) in simple terms: an autoimmune inflammation affecting the eye’s pigment layer and retina that can cause blurred vision, blind spots, light sensitivity, and sometimes headaches or hearing/skin changes. Emphasize urgency: start systemic corticosteroid treatment promptly to reduce inflammation and prevent permanent vision loss. Describe treatment plan basics: high-dose oral steroids (or IV in severe cases), possible topical steroid and cycloplegic drops for comfort, stomach protection (e.g., ranitidine or PPI), and that steroid taper is slow (months) to lower relapse risk. Discuss monitoring: frequent eye exams early, OCT/angiography as needed, and alertness for side effects (increased blood sugar, weight gain, mood changes, stomach upset, infection risk). Advise reporting immediately any worsening vision, new floaters, severe eye pain, fever, or symptoms suggesting systemic involvement (hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, hair/skin changes). Outline possible additional therapies: if steroids are insufficient or intolerable, other immunosuppressants may be used. Discuss long-term risks and follow-up: potential cataract, glaucoma, or choroidal neovascularization that may require treatment; importance of adherence to medication and appointments. Offer supportive advice: avoid live vaccines while immunosuppressed, maintain good bone, stomach, and glucose care (calcium/vitamin D, diet), and communicate steroid side effects to the team. Provide reassurance but stress close follow-up and prompt reporting of new symptoms.
Emergency Instructions: Seek immediate ophthalmic care for sudden vision loss, new or worsening blind spots, severe eye pain, marked redness, flashes/floaters, or symptoms of increased intraocular pressure; if on high-dose systemic steroids, go to the emergency department for severe abdominal pain, black/tarry stools, vomiting blood, or signs of infection (fever/chills).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 32-year-old woman with AIDS (CD4 64) on HAART presenting with 2 weeks of new floaters and multiple black spots OU. Exam: BCVA 20/30 OD, 20/40 OS; IOP 10 mm Hg OU; quiet anterior segments. Fundus OD: confluent, creamy yellow–white retinitis with prominent intralesional hemorrhage and active vitritis with vascular sheathing along the superotemporal arcade; OS: peripheral temporal retinitis without hemorrhage. Clinical picture most consistent with CMV retinitis (fulminant/hemorrhagic form OD, granular form OS) in the context of advanced immunosuppression. Differential includes acute retinal necrosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilitic placoid retinitis, and other opportunistic infections, but lack of significant anterior chamber inflammation, location and hemorrhagic necrosis tracking along arcades, and low CD4 favor CMV. Recommend prompt ophthalmic management with intraocular and/or systemic anti-CMV therapy and coordination with infectious disease for systemic antiviral treatment and optimization of HAART; baseline and serial wide-field fundus photography/indirect ophthalmoscopy and consideration of prophylactic measures for retinal detachment; screen for other opportunistic infections and perform diagnostic testing as indicated (e.g., PCR of intraocular fluid if atypical or poor response).
Primary Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis
Differential Diagnosis: CMV retinitis; Acute retinal necrosis (herpes zoster); Ocular toxoplasmosis; Syphilitic retinitis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Retinal detachment; choroidal neovascularization (CNVM); cystoid macular edema (CME); epiretinal membrane (ERM); RPE atrophy and scarring; optic neuropathy; neovascular glaucoma


Plan
All Medications: highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) oral corticosteroids periocular steroids systemic steroids immunosuppression / immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine) antituberculosis therapy intravitreal steroids anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
All Procedures: Funduscopic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy; fluorescein angiography; optical coherence tomography (OCT); indocyanine green angiography (ICG); fundus autofluorescence (FAF); electroretinogram (ERG); Goldmann and Humphrey visual field testing; fundus photography; Amsler grid testing; laboratory evaluation for infectious etiologies (syphilis, tuberculosis) (standard-of-care)
Patient Education: Your eye condition involves inflammation of the back of the eye (choroid/RPE), which often causes sudden changes in vision such as blurred vision, scotomas (blind spots), and photopsias (flashes). Many “white dot” syndromes follow a viral-like illness and most are self-limited and improve over weeks to months. Eye imaging (fluorescein angiography, OCT, and sometimes indocyanine green or autofluorescence) helps confirm the diagnosis and monitor healing. Most entities (MEWDS, APMPPE, ARPE, PIC) have a good prognosis without treatment and vision often recovers substantially, but some forms (serpiginous, birdshot, multifocal choroiditis) are chronic, can recur, and may require immunosuppressive therapy to prevent permanent vision loss. Seek prompt ophthalmic care for any new floaters, flashes, or visual field loss; if your lesions involve the central macula or you have neurologic symptoms (headache, focal deficits), treatment (often oral corticosteroids) or neurologic evaluation may be indicated. Regular follow-up with retinal imaging is important to monitor activity and detect complications such as cystoid macular edema or choroidal neovascularization, which may need additional treatments (steroids, immunomodulation, or anti‑VEGF injections).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right eye: medium-sized choroidal melanoma.
Primary Diagnosis: Right eye: medium-sized choroidal melanoma
Differential Diagnosis: Choroidal nevus; Metastatic carcinoma to the choroid; Choroidal hemangioma; Melanocytoma
Severity: Medium
Laterality: Right eye
Complications: Radiation-related complications including retinopathy, optic neuropathy, and cataract; radiation-vasculopathy and optic neuropathy (occurring in ~30–50% at 5 years for tumors adjacent to optic nerve or fovea)


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter; perform clinical exam, fundus photography, and ultrasonography at each visit, with AF and OCT as needed; for patients with gene expression profiling: class 1A—annual liver imaging; class 1B—annual liver imaging and liver enzymes staggered by 6 months; class 2—liver imaging and liver enzymes every 6 months staggered by 3 months.
Patient Education: Diagnosis: choroidal melanoma — a malignant tumor in the pigmented layer of the eye. Treatment options depend on tumor size/location and include plaque (brachytherapy) radiation to save the eye, local resection, or enucleation for very large tumors or poor vision. Small tumors may be observed or treated with transpupillary thermotherapy in select cases. Expected follow-up: frequent eye exams with fundus photos and ultrasound (every 3 months first year, then every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly) to monitor tumor regression, recurrence, and radiation complications. Systemic monitoring for metastasis (especially liver) is required long-term; timing guided by tumor risk (gene expression profile): low-risk — annual liver imaging; intermediate — annual imaging with liver enzymes staggered 6 months; high-risk — liver imaging and liver enzymes every 6 months staggered by 3 months. Possible side effects/complications: vision loss, radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy, cataract, and need for further treatment; enucleation results in loss of the eye and requires orbital prosthesis. Symptoms that should prompt immediate contact: new sudden vision loss, increasing floaters, flashes, pain, or rapid changes in appearance of the eye. Discuss genetic testing and systemic workup for metastatic disease; if relevant, referral for oncology and for genetic counseling. Offer educational materials, support resources, and review treatment risks/benefits to assist shared decision-making.
Referrals: Ocular oncology (retina/ocular oncology specialist) and medical oncology for metastatic workup and long-term systemic surveillance (including liver imaging).

CASE 51 — Cystoid Macular Edema
===============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after cataract surgery
DURATION: 6 months
LATERALITY: OD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 64-year-old woman presented with sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens insertion; during the procedure a central posterior capsular rupture occurred and the IOL was placed into the ciliary sulcus, with postoperative findings of 2+ superior microbullous corneal edema, moderate anterior chamber cells, vitreous incarceration in the wound, a round pupil, clear pupillary space, and a freely mobile PCIOL within the vitreous cavity inferiorly; vision was 20/30 with an aphakic correction at presentation.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman presented with a sudden decreased vision in the left eye 2 days after an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) insertion. During the procedure, a central posterior capsular rupture was noted, but the IOL was placed anterior to the remaining anterior capsule into the ciliary sulcus. Her vision was 20/30 in the left eye with an aphakic correction. Slit-lamp examination showed a 2+ microbullous corneal edema superiorly and moderate cells in the anterior chamber. The pupil was round, but there was vitreous incarceration in the wound. The pupillary space was clear. Residual capsule was not noted. Funduscopic examination disclosed a freely mobile PCIOL within the vitreous cavity inferiorly. The retina was attached. Surgery was recommended and performed with repositioning of the dislocated PCIOL into the ciliary sulcus using a scleral suturing technique to fixate the haptics. The scleral fixation sutures were placed through two partial-thickness superotemporal and inferonasal scleral flaps to cover the suture knots. The IOL was in good position 1 month postoperatively with vision at 20/60. The vision returned to 20/20 within 6 months and remained so 6 years after the surgical repair. The IOL remained centered and well positioned, with no sign of complication. In the right eye, the vision was 20/400 due to nuclear sclerosis.
Symptom Onset: 2 days after surgery
Symptom Duration: 2 days
Progression: Resolved (vision returned to 20/20 within 6 months and remained stable for 6 years)
Characteristics: Cystoid macular edema following intraocular surgery (postoperative/pseudophakic), characterized by macular thickening with cystic intraretinal spaces on OCT and macular fluorescein pooling on angiography, often associated with inflammation, vitreous prolapse/incarceration, and possible IOL dislocation after complicated cataract extraction.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema of the right eye (OD) following complicated cataract extraction with posterior capsular rupture and subsequent intraocular lens dislocation; clinical exam and imaging (FA/OCT) demonstrate macular thickening with cystic changes. Initial management with topical NSAID and corticosteroid therapy is recommended with close follow-up in 4–6 weeks; consider periocular or intravitreal steroid injection or pars plana vitrectomy if medical therapy fails or if vitreomacular traction/retained lens material is present. Continue monitoring for recurrence and associated retinal pigment epithelium atrophy.
Primary Diagnosis: Postoperative (pseudophakic) cystoid macular edema, OD
Differential Diagnosis: Pseudophakic (Irvine–Gass) cystoid macular edema; Vitreomacular traction–induced macular edema; Inflammatory/postoperative uveitic macular edema; Retained lens fragment–associated macular edema
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OD
Complications: - Posterior capsular rupture - Vitreous prolapse/incarceration in the wound - Dislocated PCIOL into the vitreous cavity (IOL dislocation) - Microbullous corneal edema - Anterior chamber inflammation (cells) - Cystoid macular edema


Plan
All Medications: flurbiprofen (topical), suprofen (topical), ketorolac 0.5% (topical), prednisolone 1% (topical), periocular corticosteroid injection, intravitreal corticosteroid injection, ranibizumab (intravitreal anti-VEGF), bevacizumab (intravitreal anti-VEGF), aflibercept (intravitreal anti-VEGF)
All Procedures: extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens insertion; repositioning of dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens with scleral suturing fixation via pars plana approach (scleral fixation through partial-thickness superotemporal and inferonasal scleral flaps); pars plana vitrectomy (as a general option)
Follow-Up Instructions: Observe within 4 to 6 weeks after initiating medical treatment; follow carefully thereafter with ongoing monitoring for recurrence.
Patient Education: Cystoid macular edema (CME) is swelling in the central retina that can occur after eye surgery. It often causes blurred or decreased central vision but may improve with treatment or on its own over weeks to months. Diagnosis is made by eye exam and retinal imaging (OCT, fluorescein angiography). First-line treatment is topical anti-inflammatory eye drops: a steroid (e.g., prednisolone) and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (e.g., ketorolac) used together. If there is no improvement after 4–6 weeks, additional options include periocular or intravitreal steroid injections, anti-VEGF injections (less predictable), or surgical treatment (vitrectomy) if vitreous traction or retained lens material is present. Keep all follow-up appointments; vision may gradually improve but can recur, and chronic cases can cause lasting vision loss. Report new pain, marked vision loss, flashes, or new floaters promptly.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased visual acuity in the right eye 8 weeks after phacoemulsification
DURATION: 8 weeks
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "the visual acuity was excellent postoperatively but declined substantially after the first 4 weeks."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 66-year-old woman presented 8 weeks after phacoemulsification complaining of decreased visual acuity in the right eye. An acrylic intraocular lens had been placed in the ciliary sulcus at the time of surgery because of a central posterior capsular rupture. Vision was excellent postoperatively but declined substantially after the first 4 weeks. She reported no other contributory medical or ophthalmic history, including diabetes or hypertension.
History Narrative: A 66-year-old woman presented 8 weeks after phacoemulsification complaining of decreased visual acuity in the right eye. An acrylic intraocular lens was inserted into the ciliary sulcus at the time of surgery due to a central posterior capsular rupture. The patient reported that the visual acuity was excellent postoperatively but declined substantially after the first 4 weeks. The patient reported no other contributory medical or ophthalmic history including diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Symptom Onset: 8 weeks after phacoemulsification
Symptom Duration: 8 weeks
Characteristics: Intraocular infection causing severe intraocular inflammation, often postoperative, presenting with pain, decreased vision, conjunctival hyperemia, hypopyon, fibrin, and vitreous opacities; can be acute or chronic, exogenous (postoperative, post-injection, posttraumatic, bleb-associated) or endogenous (hematogenous), variable onset and severity depending on organism virulence.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: - Intraocular surgery (especially cataract surgery) - Posterior capsular rupture, vitreous loss, retained nuclear or cortical material - Intravitreal injections - Ocular trauma - Bleb-related surgery (filtering blebs) - Immunodeficiency, diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug use, indwelling catheters, malignancy (risk for endogenous endophthalmitis)
Associated Symptoms: Decreased visual acuity (progressive vision loss), painless inflammation (characteristic of late-onset cases), no pain, no conjunctival hyperemia or other systemic symptoms reported.
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — decreased vision to 20/80 in the affected eye likely causes noticeable difficulty with activities requiring fine vision (reading, driving) but some function preserved.
Systemic Symptoms: No other systemic symptoms reported
Risk Factors: - Recent intraocular surgery (especially cataract surgery) - Intravitreal injections - Ocular trauma - Retained lens material, posterior capsular rupture, vitreous loss - Bleb-associated surgery (filtration bleb) - Immunodeficiency - Diabetes mellitus - Intravenous drug use - Indwelling catheters - Malignancy - Use of prostaglandin analogs (postoperative risk factor) - Use of preservative-containing intravitreal triamcinolone (sterile inflammation mimic) - Lack of povidone-iodine antisepsis or breaches in sterile technique

Assessment Narrative: Acute postoperative endophthalmitis, left eye.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute postoperative endophthalmitis
Differential Diagnosis: Infectious endophthalmitis (acute postoperative); Toxic anterior segment syndrome; Retained lens material–induced inflammation; Exacerbation of preexisting uveitis
Severity: Acute postoperative (moderate–severe)

Plan
All Medications: vancomycin ceftazidime amikacin dexamethasone topical vancomycin aminoglycoside povidone-iodine aflibercept triamcinolone fourth-generation fluoroquinolones
All Procedures: vitreous tap and intravitreal injection of antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime)
Follow-Up Instructions: Prompt intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin + ceftazidime or amikacin) after vitreous tap; consider addition of intravitreal dexamethasone based on inflammation/fungal suspicion; obtain vitreous cultures and smears; follow clinically with frequent examinations to monitor response and vision; perform PPV promptly if presenting vision is light perception only or if deterioration despite tap-and-inject; for chronic or suspected P. acnes consider PPV with partial/total capsulectomy and possible IOL exchange/removal; involve infectious disease for endogenous cases and give systemic antibiotics/antifungals as indicated.
Patient Education: You have an infection inside your eye called endophthalmitis, most often occurring after eye surgery. It can cause decreased vision and may become serious if not treated promptly. Treatment generally involves taking a sample of the eye fluid and injecting strong antibiotics directly into the eye; surgery (vitrectomy) is recommended if vision is very poor or if the infection is severe. If the infection is delayed or indolent, a more extensive surgery to remove lens/capsule material may be needed. Because some infections can come from elsewhere in the body, blood-borne causes may require systemic antibiotics or antifungals and coordination with your physician. Prevention measures around surgery or injections include sterile technique and povidone‑iodine; routine topical antibiotics have not been shown to reduce risk. Promptly report any increasing pain, redness, dramatic vision loss, or new floaters after surgery or injections so treatment can begin quickly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 59-year-old woman with sudden-onset severe left eye pain and vision loss 5 days after combined cataract/LASIK surgery. Exam: left eye hand-motion vision, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, shallow/flat anterior chamber with anterior chamber reaction and hypopyon, fibrin on IOL, aphakia noted at initial photo, no fundus view. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrates appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhages with moderately dense membranous vitreous opacities. Diagnosis: appositional suprachoroidal hemorrhage of the left eye (kissing choroidals) likely postoperative in setting of recent intraocular surgery. Management: emergent vitreous tap with intravitreal vancomycin, ceftazidime, and dexamethasone for presumed acute postoperative endophthalmitis; topical hourly fortified antibiotics, topical steroid and cycloplegic. Serial echography for liquefaction; conservative medical management with IOP and pain control while awaiting liquefaction for possible delayed surgical drainage; surgical drainage/pars plana vitrectomy considered if uncontrolled IOP, persistent severe pain, persistent kissing choroidals, macular/retinal involvement, or retinal detachment. Prognosis guarded; factors for poor outcome include retinal apposition >14 days, >2 quadrants involvement, poor presenting acuity, afferent pupillary defect, or concurrent retinal detachment.
Primary Diagnosis: Appositional (“kissing”) suprachoroidal hemorrhage
Secondary Diagnoses: Suprachoroidal hemorrhage; Appositional ("kissing") suprachoroidal hemorrhage; Aphakia; Postoperative endophthalmitis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis

Plan
All Medications: parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics; tetanus toxoid vaccine; intravenous antibiotics (continued ~36 hours)
All Procedures: vitrectomy; lensectomy; intraocular lens (IOL) implantation; magnetic extraction of intraocular foreign body (IOFB); low encircling scleral buckle placement; laser photocoagulation (endolaser) around retinal defect; anterior chamber entry and corneoscleral laceration closure (primary globe repair)
Follow-Up Instructions: As long as anatomic and visual stabilization is observed, lengthen follow-up intervals; cicatricial response completed by ~6 weeks. Consider additional surgery (epiretinal membrane removal or secondary IOL) at ~3 months if needed. Recommend shatter‑proof safety glasses; coordinate vocational rehabilitation as indicated.
Patient Education: Wear shatter‑proof safety glasses to protect the other eye; keep a protective eye shield over the injured eye until cleared; report fever, increasing pain, worsening vision, redness, or discharge immediately (signs of infection/endophthalmitis); ensure tetanus immunization is up to date; expect close short‑term follow‑up and possible further surgeries (vitrectomy, lensectomy, IOL later) and discuss vocational rehabilitation if vision is permanently reduced.
Work Restrictions: Avoidance of activities risking ocular trauma; wear shatter‑proof safety glasses; restrict duties involving metal‑on‑metal work (e.g., hammering) until fully healed and cleared.
Emergency Instructions: Place a protective eye shield over the eye, avoid pressure on the globe, administer broad‑spectrum parenteral antibiotics, check tetanus status and give booster if >5 years, and arrange urgent ophthalmic surgical evaluation for globe repair.


CASE 55 — Intraocular Foreign Body
==================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor vision after a fall (noticed upon waking the morning after the fall)
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: An 80‑year‑old nursing‑home woman fell onto a piece of furniture the prior day; periocular ecchymoses suggested direct ocular trauma. She had no immediate pain or noticed visual loss but awoke the next morning with poor vision and sought care. She had prior cataract surgery (extracapsular nuclear expression) 3 years earlier and preinjury vision 20/30 limited by atrophic macular degeneration. On presentation vision was hand motions, IOP 10 mm Hg; cornea relatively clear, formed AC, conjunctival chemosis temporally and superiorly, scleral dehiscence at prior cataract wound with posterior chamber IOL in subconjunctival space, dense vitreous hemorrhage limiting posterior view, pupil not peaked, no vitreous anterior to iris.
History Narrative: An 80-year-old woman presented the morning after falling at her nursing home. Although the exact history was unclear, periocular ecchymoses suggested direct ocular trauma on a piece of furniture. Initially, the patient had not noticed pain or visual loss, but upon waking the next morning she realized poor vision and sought consultation. Cataract surgery with a nuclear expression extracapsular technique had been performed 3 years previously. Before the injury, the vision had been documented as 20/30, limited by some atrophic macular degeneration changes. Upon presentation, visual acuity was hand motions and the intraocular pressure was 10 mm Hg. The cornea appeared relatively clear with a formed anterior chamber. However, there was conjunctival chemosis temporally and superiorly. While raising the upper lid, there was no conjunctival laceration, but a scleral dehiscence was evident, apparently at the previous cataract wound; upon examination of the superotemporal quadrant, the posterior chamber implant was seen in the subconjunctival space. The view posteriorly was limited by a dense vitreous hemorrhage. The pupil was not peaked, and there was no vitreous anterior to the iris.
Symptom Onset: Morning after fall (symptoms noted upon waking the next morning)
Symptom Duration: 1 day
Progression: Resolved
Characteristics: Retained magnetic metallic intraocular foreign body, posterior-segment (vitreous) with scleral wound/dehiscence at prior cataract incision; associated vitreous hemorrhage, focal subretinal hemorrhage, no retinal detachment, aphakia after IOL removal.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body OS with globe dehiscence at prior cataract wound, dense vitreous hemorrhage, subretinal hemorrhage superotemporally, no retinal detachment, aphakia post-IOL removal; urgent vitrectomy, IOFB removal, encircling scleral buckle placed; postop attached retina with minimal epiretinal membrane and BCVA 20/100 aphakic.
Primary Diagnosis: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Intraocular foreign body (metallic/siderotic IOFB); Retained nonmetallic IOFB (glass/plastic); Globe rupture with intraocular hemorrhage without retained IOFB; Traumatic endophthalmitis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: OS
Complications: Retained magnetic intraocular foreign body; vitreous hemorrhage; scleral wound dehiscence with extruded IOL; subretinal hemorrhage; epiretinal membrane; risk of endophthalmitis; potential retinal detachment; aphakia


Plan
All Medications: prophylactic antibiotics (systemic); intravitreal antibiotics (when indicated); systemic antibiotics (IV) postoperatively; topical corticosteroids; topical antibiotics; cycloplegic agents
All Procedures: vitrectomy; placement of an encircling scleral band (scleral buckling); removal of intraocular lens (IOL explantation); lensectomy (as part of vitrectomy)
Follow-Up Instructions: Monitor postoperatively with IV antibiotics and topical corticosteroids, antibiotics, and/or cycloplegics as indicated; discontinue systemic antibiotics if no endophthalmitis within 24–48 hours and clinical progress is good. Observe at ~1–2 week intervals during the first month, then less frequently; monitor for recurrent retinal detachment and visually significant epiretinal membrane. Consider secondary IOL implantation or aphakic contact lens if patient remains aphakic.
Patient Education: Avoid MRI until foreign body is confirmed nonmetallic. Wear protective eyewear in high‑risk settings. Seek immediate care for eye trauma; early removal of metallic intraocular foreign bodies reduces infection and toxicity risk. Expect possible surgery (vitrectomy, lens removal, scleral buckle), antibiotics (often IV and/or intravitreal), and follow‑up visits to monitor for infection, retinal detachment, or epiretinal membrane; vision may remain reduced and secondary lens surgery may be needed.

Examination elsewhere had shown visual acuity 20/20 OU, normal color vision and full visual fields, pupils 8 mm OD and 4 mm OS with the right pupil nonreactive to light or near and the left pupil reacting briskly; no relative afferent pupillary defect, normal motility without ptosis, normal facial sensation and strength, and slit-lamp and fundus exams without iris irregularity or optic disc swelling. Clinical impression was most consistent with pharmacologic mydriasis rather than third nerve palsy or tonic pupil.
Symptom Onset: Several years ago, worsening over the last few months
Symptom Duration: several years
Progression: Acute, usually unilateral loss of visual acuity and/or visual field with eventual visual improvement (most improve ≥1 line by day 15 and ≥1 line by day 30; recovery often nearly complete by 30 days, may continue for months)
Characteristics: Acute unilateral vision loss with periocular pain (worse on eye movement), decreased color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, young adult (<40), normal fundus (retrobulbar optic neuritis), typically MRI-positive for demyelinating lesions, improved with IV steroids per ONTT.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Head movement/eye movement (periocular pain worse with eye movement)
Associated Symptoms: Headaches, blurry vision (worse with headaches), anisocoria, eye pain on movement not reported in this case but general — however specific to this patient: headaches and blurry vision.
Systemic Symptoms: Headache (chronic, worse over months), no nausea or vomiting, no diplopia, otherwise denied systemic symptoms.
Risk Factors: - Young adult age (<40 years) - History of demyelinating lesions on MRI (white matter lesions) - Three or more demyelinating lesions on MRI - History of nonspecific neurologic symptoms - History of previous optic neuritis - Increased cerebrospinal fluid IgG - Monocular involvement or occupational need to recover vision rapidly (consideration for treatment)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right pharmacologic mydriasis causing anisocoria; no evidence of third nerve palsy or tonic pupil. Vision 20/20 OU, color vision and fields full, normal motility, no ptosis, and normal fundus without disc edema. Headaches chronic; likely accidental exposure to topical/mydriatic agent given nursing occupation. Observation recommended with dilute pilocarpine testing to confirm pharmacologic blockade; no surgical intervention. Monitor for resolution; if persistent or other neurologic signs develop, pursue further neuro-ophthalmic workup.
Primary Diagnosis: Optic neuritis
Secondary Diagnoses: Anisocoria; Pharmacologic mydriasis; Headaches (chronic/diffuse)
Differential Diagnosis: Pharmacologic mydriasis; Tonic (Adie) pupil; Third cranial nerve palsy; Iris sphincter damage
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Unilateral
Complications: - Increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) - Potential progression to neuromyelitis optica (NMO) with worse visual prognosis - Persistent visual impairment (incomplete recovery) - Recurrent optic neuritis attacks - Steroid-related complications from treatment (e.g., systemic corticosteroid side effects)


Plan
All Medications: headache medications (unspecified) methylprednisolone (IV high-dose per ONTT regimen) prednisone (oral)
All Procedures: MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast; slit-lamp examination; pupillary testing including pilocarpine testing; visual acuity and visual field testing; color vision testing (HRR plates)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up with neurology and ophthalmology; obtain brain and orbital MRI to evaluate for demyelinating lesions; monitor visual acuity and visual fields with repeat eye exams (within weeks) and consider IV methylprednisolone if indicated (abnormal MRI, severe vision loss, or need for rapid recovery); test for NMO and MOG antibodies if atypical features or poor recovery.
Patient Education: - Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve that commonly causes sudden, usually one‑eye, vision loss, pain with eye movement, and decreased color vision. - Most typical cases occur in young adults and improve gradually, often beginning within 2 weeks and continuing over months; most patients regain substantial vision by 1 month. - MRI of the brain and orbits is recommended to look for demyelinating lesions (risk factor for multiple sclerosis) and to help guide treatment. - High‑dose IV corticosteroids (e.g., IV methylprednisolone followed by an oral steroid taper) speed recovery and may reduce short‑term MS risk; standard‑dose oral prednisone alone is not recommended. - Atypical features (both eyes affected at once, lack of pain, severe disc swelling, worsening or no improvement by 3–4 weeks, or other systemic signs) require further testing for infectious or inflammatory causes such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or MOG antibody disease. - If NMO or MOG is suspected, additional blood tests and longer or different immunosuppressive treatment may be needed. - Report any new neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, balance problems), worsening vision, or lack of improvement; follow neuro‑ophthalmology and neurology as advised. - Use supportive measures: avoid activities that markedly increase body temperature if vision is worse with heat, and arrange for visual aids and safety measures while vision is impaired.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 57 Optic Disc Edema with Macular Star (Neuroretinitis) — ODEMS likely secondary to cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae). Right eye: acute, painful vision loss for 12 days with VA 20/80, RAPD, superior arcuate field defect, hyperemic swollen optic disc; macular star present. Left eye normal. Clinical picture and positive Bartonella serology support neuroretinitis; alternate causes (other infections, inflammatory, demyelinating, compressive, ischemic) considered less likely. Management: typically benign and may resolve over months; treat identified infectious cause with appropriate antibiotics; no surgical intervention indicated. Follow-up for visual recovery and possible late macular star formation; ODEMS not predictive of MS.
Primary Diagnosis: ODEMS (neuroretinitis secondary to cat-scratch disease)
Differential Diagnosis: Demyelinating optic neuritis (typical ON); Neuroretinitis due to Bartonella henselae (cat-scratch disease); Other infectious causes (syphilis, Lyme, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis); Inflammatory/NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Optic atrophy; macular retinal pigment epithelial changes; possible residual visual disability; recurrence in same or fellow eye


Plan
All Medications: antibiotics (unspecified)
Follow-Up Instructions: Reevaluate within 2 weeks for development of a macular star; routine ophthalmic follow-up to monitor visual recovery and for signs of optic atrophy or recurrence.
Patient Education: ODEMS (neuroretinitis) from cat-scratch disease often improves over weeks to months and usually has a good visual prognosis; avoid strenuous exercise or activities that worsen vision until improved; return for follow-up in 1–2 weeks to recheck the macula (a macular star can appear later) and sooner for any worsening; if Bartonella infection confirmed, take prescribed antibiotics as directed and finish the course; report new symptoms such as increasing vision loss, severe pain, fever, or neurologic changes immediately.


CASE 58 — Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy—Nonarteritic
=========================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden painless vision loss upon awakening
DURATION: 3 weeks
LATERALITY: OS
PATIENT QUOTES: "blurred vision in her right eye"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 22-year-old woman with 3 weeks of blurred vision in the right eye, onset about one week after a nonspecific “flulike” illness, associated with minimal right periorbital pain, occasional mild diffuse headaches, and 1+ vitreous cells; no prior medical, ophthalmologic, or neurologic illnesses; three cats at home.
History Narrative: A 22-year-old woman noted the onset of blurred vision in her right eye 3 weeks ago. She noted minimal right periorbital pain. She denied any history of previous medical, ophthalmologic, or neurologic illnesses, but she did complain of recent occasional headaches of mild and diffuse nature and noted that the visual blurring seemed to have started a week or so after a nonspecific “flulike” illness. She has three cats at home. Examination revealed visual acuity to be 20/60 on the right and 20/15 on the left. She identified 4 of 10 pseudoisochromatic plates on the right and 10 of 10 on the left. Visual field examination revealed a cecocentral scotoma on the right and was normal on the left. Pupils were 5mm bilaterally and equally reactive to light and near, but there was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Motility examination was normal. The right fundus exam revealed significant optic disc edema with peripapillary and macular exudates, the latter in a star configuration. There were 1+ vitreous cells on the right. The left fundus examination was normal.
Symptom Onset: 3 weeks ago
Symptom Duration: 3 weeks

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) of the right eye. Sudden, painless vision loss with sectoral disc edema, macular exudates, right relative afferent pupillary defect, color dyschromatopsia, and cecocentral scotoma consistent with NAION. Fellow eye shows small cup-to-disc ratio, increasing risk for involvement. Vascular risk–factor control recommended; no proven acute therapy—consider aspirin and discuss corticosteroids risks/benefits. Monitor fellow eye and visual function; counsel regarding ~12% lifetime risk to fellow eye and possible spontaneous improvement by 6 months.
Primary Diagnosis: Nonarteritic AION, OS
Differential Diagnosis: Neuroretinitis (infectious or idiopathic); Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION); Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (giant cell arteritis); Central or branch retinal vein occlusion
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: OS
Complications: Risk of AION in the fellow eye (≈12% lifetime); potential permanent visual loss in affected eye; increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (associated vascular risk factors)


Plan
All Medications: phenytoin; erythropoietin; intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies; topical brimonidine; levodopa; aspirin; corticosteroids
Follow-Up Instructions: The risk of AION in the fellow eye is approximately 12% in the patient’s lifetime. Control vascular/stroke risk factors. Consider aspirin to possibly decrease fellow‑eye AION and cardiovascular risk (unproven). Arrange ophthalmic follow‑up to monitor vision and disc status (eg, repeat exam and visual fields); provide vision rehabilitation as needed.
Patient Education: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is sudden, usually painless vision loss due to decreased blood flow to the optic nerve. Key points: - Cause and risk: It is often associated with vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol) and a small optic nerve “cup”; it is not caused by infection in typical NAION. - Prognosis: Some spontaneous visual improvement can occur (≈40% improve by 6 months), but many patients have permanent visual field loss. There is a roughly 10–15% lifetime risk of involvement of the fellow eye. - What to watch for: Report any new or worsening vision loss, new headaches, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, or systemic symptoms immediately (these could suggest giant cell arteritis and require urgent evaluation). - Risk reduction: Optimize control of vascular risk factors—blood pressure, blood sugar, lipids—and discuss aspirin with your clinician (may lower stroke/heart attack risk and possibly fellow-eye risk, though benefit for NAION is unproven). - No proven treatment: There is no consistently effective therapy for acute NAION; some clinicians consider corticosteroids in select cases but this is controversial. Surgical optic nerve sheath fenestration is not helpful and may be harmful. - Follow-up and rehabilitation: Regular ophthalmology follow-up for monitoring, visual field testing, and low-vision rehabilitation as needed; consider referral for occupational or mobility training if vision impairment affects daily activities. - When to seek urgent care: sudden new vision loss in either eye, or systemic symptoms suggestive of giant cell arteritis.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 65-year-old woman with acute, painless severe vision loss of the left eye on awakening 3 days ago. Exam: VA 20/20 OD, 20/200 OS; color vision 10/10 OD, 2/10 OS; dense inferior altitudinal field defect OS; left RAPD; left optic disc diffusely swollen, pallid with peripapillary hemorrhages; fellow optic nerve cup-to-disc 0.1. Elevated ESR 70 mm/h and CRP 20 mg/dL. Temporal artery biopsy positive for transmural lymphocytic infiltration with multinucleated giant cells and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. Clinical picture and laboratory/histopathology consistent with arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy due to giant cell arteritis. Immediate high-dose corticosteroid therapy indicated to prevent further visual loss.
Primary Diagnosis: Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (giant cell arteritis)
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Hypercholesterolemia; Diabetes mellitus; Polymyalgia rheumatica (history suggestive)
Differential Diagnosis: Ischemic optic neuropathy (arteritic AION); Nonarteritic AION; Optic neuritis; Compressive optic neuropathy
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Left
Complications: Further visual loss in the involved or fellow eye (including bilateral blindness); systemic complications of giant cell arteritis such as stroke, large-vessel ischemia; steroid-related adverse effects from prolonged high‑dose therapy.


Plan
All Medications: prednisone (oral) 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day; methylprednisolone (IV) 1000 mg/day; methotrexate (steroid‑sparing agent)
All Procedures: Sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) testing; temporal artery biopsy; initiation of high‑dose corticosteroid therapy (oral prednisone 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day; consideration of IV methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day in severe cases).
Follow-Up Instructions: Careful monitoring for visual impairment and constitutional symptoms; serial ESR/CRP to guide therapy; regular assessment for steroid adverse effects; coordination with internist/rheumatologist for systemic management and consideration of steroid‑sparing agents if needed; arrange temporal artery biopsy (if not yet done) and close ophthalmic follow‑up.
Patient Education: You have an inflammation of medium–large arteries called giant cell arteritis (GCA) that caused sudden vision loss in one eye due to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Immediate treatment with high‑dose corticosteroids is necessary to reduce the risk of further vision loss in the affected or the other eye. Steroids should be started right away and will often be continued for many months with a gradual taper; some people need longer-term therapy or steroid‑sparing medicines. A temporal artery biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis but should not delay starting treatment. You will need close follow‑up with your eye doctor and a rheumatologist/internist for monitoring of vision, symptoms, and steroid side effects, and periodic ESR/CRP blood tests to help gauge inflammation. Report new symptoms immediately (worsening vision, vision loss in the other eye, new severe headache, jaw pain with chewing, scalp tenderness, or systemic symptoms).
Referrals: Internist and/or rheumatologist
Emergency Instructions: Start high‑dose corticosteroids immediately (oral prednisone 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day; consider IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day if severe vision loss <48 hours, bilateral involvement, or monocular patient). Do not delay treatment for temporal artery biopsy. Monitor vision closely and arrange urgent temporal artery biopsy and rheumatology/internist consultation.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Compressive optic neuropathy of the right optic nerve secondary to an optic nerve sheath meningioma evidenced by T1 postcontrast MRI showing optic nerve sheath enhancement. Recommend close observation with serial clinical exams, visual fields, and repeat MRIs (every 6 months ×2 years then yearly if stable); consider stereotactic conformal radiation therapy if progressive visual deterioration. Surgical resection generally not recommended unless exophytic tumor or progressive intracranial extension threatens fellow eye.
Primary Diagnosis: Compressive optic neuropathy due to optic nerve sheath meningioma
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Giant cell arteritis (suspected — history of jaw claudication and PMR-like symptoms)
Differential Diagnosis: Optic nerve sheath meningioma; compressive optic neuropathy from intracranial meningioma/pituitary adenoma/craniopharyngioma; arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (giant cell arteritis)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: Progressive vision loss; optic atrophy; permanent visual impairment; possible fellow-eye involvement if intracranial extension; need for long-term monitoring and potential radiation-related complications


Plan
All Procedures: close observation; stereotactic conformal radiation therapy; surgical debulking (for exophytic lesions); gross total resection or subtotal excision (for intracranial meningiomas with optic nerve involvement); postoperative radiation therapy (considered for nonresectable or progressive/high-grade tumors); serial clinical reevaluation with visual fields and repeat MRIs (follow-up imaging every ~6 months for 2 years then yearly)
Follow-Up Instructions: Serial clinical reevaluation (e.g., every 6 months) including visual fields and repeat MRIs (e.g., every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly if no growth)
Patient Education: You have a tumor (optic nerve sheath meningioma) compressing the optic nerve, which can cause progressive, painless vision loss, decreased color vision, and an afferent pupillary defect. MRI with contrast is the key test to follow the tumor. Treatment options depend on how the tumor behaves: small, stable tumors are often observed with regular follow-up; if vision worsens or the tumor grows, stereotactic/conformal radiation is commonly recommended. Surgery is rarely used for primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas because it often risks further vision loss; it may be considered for certain growing or intracranial tumors. Follow-up typically includes eye exams with visual acuity and visual field testing and repeat MRI every ~6 months for 2 years, then yearly if stable. Report any new or worsening vision changes, new headaches, or other neurologic symptoms promptly.


CASE 61 — Papilledema–Pseudotumor Cerebri
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: painless progressive visual loss in her right eye
DURATION: 3 years
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "vision was no better after the surgery"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 64‑year‑old woman with a multi‑year history of painless, progressive visual loss in the right eye beginning ~3 years ago with initial mild blurring (VA 20/40 OD, 20/20 OS), gradual decline to 20/60 then to 20/100 despite right cataract surgery one year after onset that did not improve vision. She denied headache or eye pain. She has transient visual obscurations, tinnitus and bilateral disc edema noted earlier with progressive unilateral optic atrophy and a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Neuroimaging showed signs of increased intracranial pressure (bilateral optic nerve sheath CSF signal, empty sella) with normal MRV; lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure (350 mm H2O) with normal CSF contents, consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
History Narrative: A 64-year-old woman with a three-year history of painless, progressive visual loss in the right eye. Three years earlier she noted mild visual blurring in the right eye with visual acuity 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS, attributed to nuclear sclerotic cataract and observed. Over the following year vision in the right eye worsened to 20/60 leading to right cataract surgery, but vision did not improve and continued to deteriorate. At presentation she denied headache or eye pain. She reported progressive visual decline on the right over years with associated color vision loss on the right; no systemic symptoms described.
Symptom Onset: 3 years prior
Symptom Duration: 3 years
Progression: Progressive visual loss over 3 years
Characteristics: Painless progressive visual loss in one eye with headaches, tinnitus, transient visual obscurations, bilateral disc edema, obesity, elevated intracranial pressure (opening pressure 350 mm H2O), normal CSF contents, normal MRI/MRV except signs of increased ICP (optic nerve sheath CSF signal, empty sella), no secondary cause.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Papilledema due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) — obese woman with headaches, tinnitus, transient visual obscurations, bilateral disc edema; neuroimaging (MRI with optic nerve sheath fluid signal and empty sella) and MRV without venous occlusion; lumbar puncture opening pressure 350 mm H2O with normal CSF contents; diagnosis consistent with IIH. Plan: serial visual function monitoring; weight reduction; medical therapy (acetazolamide 1–2 g/day unless contraindicated, consider furosemide add‑on or other CAI if intolerant); avoid routine repeated LPs; consider surgical options (optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting) if medical therapy fails or vision worsens; close follow‑up monthly for 6–12 months with visual fields, optic nerve imaging, acuity, color vision, and RAPD assessment.
Primary Diagnosis: Papilledema (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension / Pseudotumor cerebri)
Secondary Diagnoses: Obesity; Headaches; Tinnitus; Transient visual obscurations; Papilledema (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
Differential Diagnosis: Compressive optic neuropathy (orbital or intracanalicular mass, e.g., meningioma); Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri); Optic atrophy secondary to chronic glaucoma; Inflammatory/infectious optic neuropathy (e.g., sarcoidosis, syphilis)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: acetazolamide; methazolamide (Neptazane); furosemide (Lasix); corticosteroids
All Procedures: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without gadolinium contrast; magnetic resonance venography (MRV); computed tomography (CT) of brain and orbit with and without contrast; lumbar puncture (spinal tap) with opening pressure measurement; serial visual field testing (perimetry); color vision testing; optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF); ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt; lumboperitoneal shunt; stenting for cerebral venous sinus stenosis; repeated lumbar punctures; cataract surgery; fundus photography; optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerves; stereo-optic disc photography
Follow-Up Instructions: Return monthly for 6–12 months with careful evaluation of formal visual fields, stereo optic‑disc photos, OCT of the nerves, visual acuity, color vision, and RAPD testing; lengthen interval if stable but continue close long‑term follow‑up for possible recurrence or shunt failure.
Patient Education: Weight reduction can improve papilledema and reduce intracranial pressure; discuss diet and possibly bariatric surgery if morbidly obese. Acetazolamide (1–2 g/day) is effective for most patients but avoid or use cautiously in pregnancy—consult obstetrician. Regular monitoring of vision (visual fields, acuity, color vision, optic nerve photos/OCT) is essential; return monthly for 6–12 months initially. If medical therapy fails, surgical options include CSF shunting (VP or lumboperitoneal) or optic nerve sheath fenestration; discuss risks/benefits. Headache may need symptomatic treatment; repeated lumbar punctures are generally not recommended as primary therapy. Seek urgent care for worsening vision, persistent transient visual obscurations, new focal neurologic signs, or severe headaches.

Laterality: Right
Complications: optic atrophy


Plan
All Medications: Dopamine agonists (for prolactin-secreting tumors)
All Procedures: Decompressive surgical removal of the pituitary (suprasellar) mass (transsphenoidal pituitary tumor decompression)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up ophthalmologic examinations with visual field testing every 4 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter, with periodic MRI scans to monitor for tumor growth.
Patient Education: You have a compressive lesion at the junction of the right optic nerve and the optic chiasm (pituitary adenoma) causing vision loss in the right eye and a visual field defect in the left eye. Key points: - The tumor can press on the optic nerves causing progressive, painless vision loss and visual field defects; prompt treatment reduces risk of permanent vision loss. - Recommended care includes pituitary hormone evaluation, MRI imaging for diagnosis and monitoring, and typically surgical decompression (transsphenoidal resection) ± medical therapy (e.g., dopamine agonists for prolactinomas) or adjunctive radiation/chemotherapy depending on pathology. - Expect baseline and serial ophthalmic exams (visual acuity, color vision, pupillary testing, formal visual fields, and optic nerve imaging) and periodic MRIs after treatment to monitor tumor and recovery. - Report any new symptoms immediately: sudden vision loss, worsening visual field, new double vision, severe headache, changes in menstruation or libido, fatigue, symptoms of hormone imbalance, or signs of cerebrospinal fluid leak after surgery. - Rehabilitation includes low-vision support if deficits persist; follow-up schedule is typically every 4 months for the first year, then every 6 months with periodic MRIs. - Lifestyle and safety: avoid activities that risk head injury until cleared; arrange assistance for driving if visual fields or acuity are impaired.
Referrals: Neurosurgery (for decompressive surgical removal) and endocrinology (for pituitary hormone evaluation and replacement)

Secondary Diagnoses: Pituitary macroadenoma causing chiasmal compression (bitemporal hemianopia); right optic neuropathy with optic disc pallor and relative afferent pupillary defect
Differential Diagnosis: Pituitary macroadenoma; Craniopharyngioma; Suprasellar meningioma; Chiasmal glioma
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: bromocriptine
All Procedures: MRI of the sella; surgical resection of pituitary adenoma (transsphenoidal surgery); possible postoperative radiation therapy; endocrinologic follow-up and hormonal replacement; visual field and ophthalmologic examinations at specified intervals (post-op as tolerated, 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, yearly for 5 years, then every 2 years); serial MRI postoperatively (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, then yearly for several years); medical therapy for prolactinoma (bromocriptine).
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative visual field and ophthalmologic examination as soon as tolerated; then visual fields and serial ophthalmologic exams at 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly for 5 years, then every 2 years thereafter; MRI at 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly for several years; endocrinologic follow-up and hormonal replacement as needed.
Patient Education: You have a lesion compressing the optic chiasm (most likely a pituitary tumor) causing loss of peripheral (temporal) vision. Important points: - This type of vision loss is typically painless and progresses slowly; early detection and treatment can prevent further vision loss. - Neuroimaging (MRI of the sella) is needed to confirm the diagnosis and to plan treatment. - Treatment is usually surgical removal of the mass; some tumors (prolactinomas) may shrink with medication. Additional treatments can include radiation or hormone replacement as needed. - Visual fields and eye exams should be repeated after treatment and then at regular intervals to monitor recovery and detect recurrence. - Report new headaches, worsening vision, double vision, nausea/vomiting, or hormonal symptoms (weakness, sexual dysfunction, weight changes) promptly. - Bring a companion when traveling or driving is necessary; avoid driving until cleared, as peripheral vision loss can impair safety.
Referrals: Neuroimaging (preferably MRI of the sella) and neurosurgical consultation; endocrinology for hormonal evaluation and postoperative follow-up.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right occipital lobe infarction causing a dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia consistent with a retrochiasmal visual pathway lesion; recommend control of vascular risk factors, stroke prophylaxis (e.g., aspirin), and repeat visual fields and ophthalmologic exam in ~6 months with consideration of rehabilitation (saccadic training, prism glasses) as appropriate.
Primary Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarction causing a dense, congruous left homonymous hemianopia
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; diabetes mellitus; hyperlipidemia
Differential Diagnosis: Right occipital lobe infarct (retrochiasmal stroke); Parietal lobe infarct causing homonymous hemianopia; Optic tract lesion (e.g., compressive mass or tumor); Demyelinating lesion of retrochiasmal pathways
Severity: Dense
Laterality: Right
Complications: Difficulty reading (losing place or missing lines), poor driving performance with motor vehicle accidents, bumping left front fender, vision-related functional impairment (reduced safety), potential persistent dense homonymous hemianopia with limited treatment options and risk of stroke-related morbidity.


Plan
All Medications: acetaminophen aspirin
Follow-Up Instructions: Repeat visual fields and ophthalmologic examination approximately 6 months after onset to assess for improvement.
Patient Education: - Explanation that vision loss is due to a stroke in the right occipital lobe causing a left homonymous hemianopia (loss of the left visual field in both eyes). - Reassure that eye structures are normal; the problem is in the brain’s visual pathway. - Risk-factor modification: control blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol; smoking cessation; discuss aspirin for stroke prevention with primary care/neurology. - Driving safety: advise against driving until formally evaluated and cleared; discuss reporting requirements and occupational restrictions. - Reading and daily function strategies: use a ruler or line guide, train large saccadic eye movements toward the blind side, practice systematic scanning patterns. - Low-vision/optical options: trial of peripheral prism glasses with a low-vision specialist may help; discuss limitations. - Rehabilitation options: referral for vision rehabilitation/occupational therapy for scanning training and adaptive strategies. - Follow-up: repeat visual fields and ophthalmology exam about 6 months after onset to assess for improvement. - When to seek urgent care: new or worsening weakness, speech changes, sudden visual change, severe headache, or other stroke symptoms.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Retinal emboli from right carotid stenosis causing transient monocular visual loss; recommend vascular (carotid/aortic) and cardiac evaluation, neuroimaging (MRI), and stroke risk–factor management with antiplatelet therapy pending definitive intervention (CEA or stenting if ipsilateral carotid stenosis ≥70% and patient is surgical candidate).
Primary Diagnosis: Retinal emboli secondary to right carotid stenosis causing transient monocular visual loss
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia; Diabetes; Coronary artery disease (post–coronary artery bypass graft)
Differential Diagnosis: Retrochiasmal visual pathway lesion (occipital lobe infarct) ; Carotid artery embolism causing retinal/retrochiasmal ischemia ; Cardioembolic source (valvular thrombus or atrial fibrillation) ; Giant cell arteritis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right
Complications: Transient monocular visual loss; retinal emboli (Hollenhorst plaque); stroke risk (ipsilateral stroke); recurrent retinal/ocular vascular occlusion; persistent homonymous hemianopia (visual field defect); carotid artery restenosis; perioperative morbidity/mortality related to carotid surgery


Plan
All Medications: aspirin
All Procedures: carotid endarterectomy; carotid stenting; anticoagulation (for cardiac valvular/atrial fibrillation sources); carotid Doppler; MR angiography; CT scan; MRI; coronary bypass surgery
Follow-Up Instructions: Medical supervision of stroke risk factors; periodic reevaluation of the carotid artery for restenosis with noninvasive studies (e.g., carotid Doppler or MR angiography).
Patient Education: Explain that his brief monocular vision losses were caused by cholesterol/embolic debris from the carotid or heart traveling to the eye (Hollenhorst plaque). Emphasize that this is a warning sign for higher stroke risk and that prompt vascular and cardiac evaluation (carotid imaging, cardiac evaluation, and possible blood tests) is needed. Review stroke risk-factor control: blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes management, smoking cessation, diet/exercise, and adherence to prescribed antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy if indicated. Discuss treatment options if carotid narrowing is found (medical therapy, carotid endarterectomy or stenting) and explain the need for close follow-up with vascular/neurology and periodic carotid imaging. Advise to seek emergency care for any new sudden vision loss, weakness, numbness, speech changes, or confusion.
Referrals: Neurology (neuroimaging and stroke evaluation), Vascular surgery or vascular medicine (carotid evaluation/endarterectomy consideration), Cardiology (cardiac/aortic embolic source evaluation), Rheumatology or Neuroimmunology (giant cell arteritis evaluation if indicated), Ophthalmology (retinal vascular/retina follow-up)

CASE 67 — Third Nerve Palsy—Aneurysm
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Binocular diplopia with left-sided frontal–periorbital pain, left eyelid droop, and anisocoria (left pupil larger than right)
DURATION: 4 weeks
LATERALITY: left
PATIENT QUOTES: "stabilized" and in fact had "improved" since his right eye "drooped."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 70-year-old man with a 4-week history of binocular diplopia that developed and worsened over a 5-day period, then stabilized and partially improved after his right eye “drooped.” In the first 2 weeks he had severe right retro-orbital pain that later became minimal. He reports prior bilateral cataract extraction with otherwise stable vision, history of hypertension and diabetes, one pack-per-day smoking, and denies facial numbness, recent headache, jaw claudications, or other neurologic deficits. Examination noted visual acuity 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS, pupils 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light and near, no RAPD, complete right ptosis with markedly impaired levator function, inability to adduct, elevate, or depress the right eye with full abduction and mild incyclodeviation on depression, normal left motility, no proptosis, normal facial sensation, and otherwise normal neurologic exam; slit-lamp showed bilateral posterior chamber IOLs and fundus revealed mild bilateral diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy without optic disc pathology.
History Narrative: A 70-year-old man had a 4-week history of binocular diplopia. The diplopia developed and worsened over a 5-day period, but then stabilized and had improved since his right eye “drooped.” In the first 2 weeks he had severe retro-orbital pain on the right which became minimal. He had a history of bilateral cataract extraction but vision otherwise stable. Past medical history included hypertension and diabetes. He smoked one pack per day. He denied facial numbness, recent headache, jaw claudication, or other neurologic deficits. Examination noted visual acuity 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS, pupils 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light and near without relative afferent pupillary defect, normal visual fields, complete ptosis of the right lid with markedly impaired levator function, inability to adduct, elevate, or depress the right eye with full abduction and mild incyclodeviation on attempted depression, normal motility in the left eye, no proptosis, normal facial sensation, otherwise normal neurologic exam, bilateral posterior chamber intraocular lenses, and mild bilateral diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy without optic disc pathology.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Partial third nerve palsy (pupil-involving) of the left eye secondary to a posterior communicating artery aneurysm, presenting with acute binocular diplopia, ptosis, anisocoria (left pupil larger), and partial paresis of elevation, adduction, and depression; recommend neuroimaging (CT/CTA, MRI/MRA) and urgent neurosurgical/endovascular consultation for aneurysm repair.
Primary Diagnosis: Posterior communicating artery aneurysm causing pupil-involving left third nerve palsy
Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension; diabetes mellitus; bilateral posterior chamber intraocular lenses; mild bilateral diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy; history of smoking (tobacco use)
Differential Diagnosis: Posterior communicating artery aneurysm compressive third nerve palsy; Ischemic (microvascular) third nerve palsy due to diabetes/hypertension; Pituitary/sellar mass compressive third nerve palsy; Cavernous sinus process (thrombosis or fistula)
Severity: Severe
Laterality: left
Complications: Aneurysmal rupture with high morbidity and mortality


Plan
All Procedures: Surgery or endovascular therapy to repair the aneurysm
Follow-Up Instructions: Patch the eye to relieve the diplopia; observe for pupil changes and arrange neuroimaging (CT/CTA ± MRI/MRA and consider cerebral angiography) with timely neurosurgical/endovascular referral for aneurysm repair.
Patient Education: Explain that the drooping eyelid, double vision, and pupil change are caused by weakness of the third cranial nerve from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm — a bulge in a brain artery that can press on the nerve. Urgent treatment (surgical clipping or endovascular repair) is recommended to prevent rupture. While awaiting definitive therapy you may need to patch the affected eye or use prism/patching for diplopia and avoid activities with high rupture risk (heavy exertion, uncontrolled high blood pressure, smoking). Report any worsening headache, sudden severe pain, nausea/vomiting, loss of consciousness, or new neurologic symptoms immediately. Control vascular risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes), stop smoking, and attend scheduled neurosurgical and ophthalmic follow-up for imaging and recovery monitoring; eyelid and eye movement may improve after aneurysm repair but can take weeks to months, and further rehabilitation or strabismus surgery may be considered later if diplopia persists.
Referrals: Neurosurgery and/or interventional neuroradiology for aneurysm repair; neuro-ophthalmology follow-up.
Emergency Instructions: Surgery or endovascular therapy to repair the aneurysm is necessary to prevent aneurysmal rupture, which carries a high morbidity and mortality.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Left sixth cranial nerve palsy with left lateral rectus paresis causing esotropia and symptomatic binocular horizontal diplopia, associated with left V1 sensory disturbance and left-sided headache; neuroimaging (MRI) demonstrated a cavernous sinus meningioma accounting for combined abducens and ophthalmic-branch trigeminal involvement. Management directed at the underlying tumor (surgery/radiation as indicated) with symptomatic diplopia control (patching, prisms, consideration of early ipsilateral medial rectus botulinum injection) and follow-up for residual ophthalmoplegia and neurologic deficits.
Primary Diagnosis: Left sixth nerve palsy secondary to cavernous sinus meningioma
Secondary Diagnoses: Type II diabetes mellitus; left ophthalmic (V1) trigeminal neuropathy (sensory changes) due to cavernous sinus meningioma; left-sided headache
Differential Diagnosis: Left sixth nerve palsy due to cavernous sinus lesion (meningioma); Ischemic (microvascular) sixth nerve palsy; Cavernous sinus thrombosis or carotid-cavernous fistula; Myasthenia gravis

Patient Education: Explain that the double vision is due to weakness of the sixth cranial nerve affecting the outward-moving muscle (lateral rectus) on the left side, likely caused by a mass in the cavernous sinus (meningioma). Recommend neuroimaging (MRI) if not already done and discuss treatment options directed at the underlying lesion (observation, surgery, radiation). For symptom relief: use an eye patch (full or prism) or temporary prism glasses, consider early botulinum injection to the medial rectus to help alignment, and strabismus surgery if diplopia persists and is stable. Advise monitoring for new or worsening neurological signs (worsening double vision, facial numbness, headaches, eyelid droop) and to seek prompt care if these occur. Address diabetes control as part of overall health. Provide reassurance that some cases improve with treatment, and arrange follow-up with neuro-ophthalmology and neurosurgery/oncology as appropriate.
Referrals: Neuroimaging (MRI) / Neurosurgery and/or Radiation Oncology for cavernous sinus meningioma evaluation and management; Ophthalmology/Strabismus clinic for symptomatic diplopia management (prisms/patching/botulinum injection; possible strabismus surgery)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Right optic neuropathy and left internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to multiple sclerosis, presenting with left adduction deficit, right abducting nystagmus, slowed adducting saccades, intact convergence, and distance-predominant binocular diplopia; consider neuroimaging and evaluation for underlying cause, with symptomatic prism or surgical strabismus options if persistent.
Primary Diagnosis: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (left) due to multiple sclerosis
Secondary Diagnoses: multiple sclerosis; right optic neuritis; optic neuropathy on the right; left internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO); sixth nerve palsy (left abduction deficit); diabetes mellitus
Differential Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis–related internuclear ophthalmoplegia; brainstem (pontine/medial longitudinal fasciculus) ischemic infarct; demyelinating/inflammatory brainstem lesion (e.g., neuromyelitis optica, sarcoidosis); mass lesion/compressive brainstem pathology
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left


Plan
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for resolution of the INO is important.
Patient Education: INO is caused by a problem in the brainstem connection between the eyes (often due to multiple sclerosis). Symptoms include double vision, trouble moving one eye inward, and outward nystagmus of the other eye. Imaging (MRI with contrast) and neurologic evaluation may be needed to find the cause. Treatment targets the underlying disease; diplopia may improve on its own, with prisms or temporary occlusion for symptomatic relief, and rarely strabismus surgery if misalignment persists. Report any new or worsening symptoms (vision loss, headache, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking) promptly. Follow-up exams are important to monitor recovery.


CASE 71 — Diplopia—Ocular Myasthenia Gravis
===========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Intermittent diplopia for 6 months, worse as the day goes on, with intermittent left or right eyelid droop
DURATION: 6 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "difficulty focusing"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Intermittent diplopia for 6 months that worsens as the day progresses, with intermittent left or right eyelid droop (ptosis); symptoms fluctuate during the day.
History Narrative: A 27-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) complained of “difficulty focusing” her eyes. Her previous MS course included a history of optic neuritis in the right eye. She did have mild gait instability, bladder disturbance, and leg numbness. Her eye difficulty started several months prior to ophthalmologic evaluation. She was taking no medications. Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity to be 20/20 bilaterally. She identified 7 of 10 pseudoisochromatic plates on the right and 10 of 10 on the left. Visual fields showed a small paracentral scotoma on the right. Pupils were 5mm bilaterally and equally reactive to light and near, but there was a mild right afferent pupillary defect. The patient had a 2 prism diopter left hypertropia that was comitant in left, right, up, and down gaze. There was mild paresis of adduction in the left eye but otherwise ductions were full. On gaze to the right, the adducting saccade in the left eye was quite slow compared to the abducting saccade in the right eye. Saccades to the left and vertically were normal. On attempting to hold her gaze to the right, monocular dissociated horizontal nystagmus was noted in the right eye in the direction of abduction. Convergence was normal and was able to overcome the adduction deficit in the left eye. There was no ptosis. Facial sensation and movement were normal. Slit-lamp examination was normal. Fundus exam revealed mild temporal pallor in the right eye but was otherwise normal.
Symptom Onset: 6 months
Symptom Duration: 6 months
Progression: Worsening over the course of the day (fluctuating/progressive fatigue of symptoms)
Characteristics: Intermittent diplopia worsening throughout the day with fluctuating bilateral ptosis, paresis of both lateral rectus muscles, enhanced ptosis, positive Tensilon test, negative acetylcholine receptor antibodies — consistent with ocular myasthenia gravis.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: Symptoms worsen "as the day goes on" (fatigue/prolonged use of ocular muscles)
Alleviating Factors: Convergence (overcoming the adduction deficit)
Associated Symptoms: intermittent diplopia, intermittent left or right eyelid droop (ptosis), worsening fatigability of ocular symptoms as day progresses, fluctuating ocular motor weakness, mild gait instability, bladder disturbance, leg numbness, history of optic neuritis (decreased color vision, small paracentral scotoma, mild right afferent pupillary defect), oscillopsia
Previous Episodes: Intermittent diplopia for 6 months with intermittent eyelid droop; prior optic neuritis in right eye (history of MS)
Impact on Daily Activities: Intermittent diplopia and fluctuating ptosis that worsen throughout the day, causing difficulty with vision-related tasks (e.g., reading, driving, close work) and potentially requiring patching or spectacle crutches; may limit daily activities and require medical management.

Follow-Up Instructions: Patients need close supervision of medications used to control symptoms and should be warned of the possibility of generalization of disease; they must inform their physician immediately if new symptoms such as dysphagia, respiratory difficulty, or extremity weakness develop.
Patient Education: Warn that ocular myasthenia can fluctuate and may generalize; report immediately any new symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, breathing, or limb weakness. Use patching or prism/occlusion for troublesome diplopia; consider eyelid crutch for ptosis. Take medications as instructed and attend close follow-up for dose adjustments. Undergo chest imaging (CT or MRI) to evaluate for thymoma. Seek urgent care for respiratory symptoms.
Referrals: Mediastinal CT or MRI for thymoma evaluation; neurology referral for systemic/myasthenia management and monitoring
Emergency Instructions: Inform your physician immediately if you develop dysphagia, respiratory difficulty, or weakness of the extremities.

Differential Diagnosis: Isolated idiopathic tonic pupil (Adie’s pupil); Holmes–Adie syndrome; Oculomotor nerve palsy (partial) with sectoral iris sphincter involvement; Pharmacologic mydriasis
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: thyroid supplements
Follow-Up Instructions: No treatment except reassurance; consider unequal bifocal reading aids or unilateral frosted bifocal segment for permanent accommodative paresis; monitor for pupillary size change and possible bilateral involvement (≈4%/yr); assess for Holmes–Adie features if indicated.
Patient Education: Reassure that a tonic (Adie’s) pupil is usually benign and often requires no treatment. Explain findings: one pupil may be larger, react slowly or segmentally to light, but still constricts with near focus (light–near dissociation). Symptoms may include blurred near vision or difficulty with reading; unequal pupils can become less pronounced over time. Recommend measures for comfort and function: consider unequal bifocals or a unilateral frosted bifocal segment for persistent accommodative difficulty; use reading glasses as needed. Advise return if new symptoms occur (worsening vision, pain, headache, or other neurologic signs). Discuss that rare progression to bilateral involvement can occur and that evaluation for related conditions (e.g., Holmes–Adie features like diminished reflexes) may be done if clinically indicated.

Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis: Tonic (Adie) pupil; Pharmacologic mydriasis; Oculomotor (III) nerve palsy; Postganglionic Horner syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Medications: cocaine 10%; hydroxyamphetamine 1%; Coumadin (warfarin); aspirin; pilocarpine 0.125%
All Procedures: Topical cocaine 10% instillation in both eyes Topical hydroxyamphetamine 1% instillation in both eyes Slit-lamp biomicroscopy Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain Oral anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin) for 3 months Maintenance antiplatelet therapy with aspirin
Follow-Up Instructions: Close observation with periodic reassessment to monitor for development of other neurologic or medical signs or symptoms.
Patient Education: Horner’s syndrome itself does not usually require treatment, but it signals an underlying cause that must be identified and treated. The key points for you to know: - Cause: Horner’s results from disruption of the sympathetic pathway to the eye (ptosis, small pupil, sometimes decreased sweating). In this case it was due to a spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection. - Symptoms to watch for: new or worsening headache, neck pain, vision changes, weakness, numbness, speech changes, or new droopiness—report these immediately. - Testing and treatment: Imaging and vascular evaluation are necessary; treatment targets the underlying cause (for carotid dissection this commonly includes anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy as recommended by your physician). The eye findings themselves often do not require ocular surgery. - Prognosis and follow-up: Some nerve function may recover over months; close follow-up with neurology/vascular medicine and ophthalmology is recommended to monitor for complications or recovery. - Practical tips: Use sunglasses for light sensitivity if present; consider ptosis crutch or eyelid taping only if vision is obstructed.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 24-year-old female with long‑standing anisocoria, headaches, and blurred vision. Examination showed a pharmacologically dilated right pupil (8 mm) that was nonreactive to light and near and did not constrict to dilute pilocarpine, consistent with pharmacologic mydriasis. No treatment required; patient counseled about causes and reassured with recommendation for follow‑up to ensure resolution.
Primary Diagnosis: Pharmacologic mydriasis
Secondary Diagnoses: Pharmacologic mydriasis
Differential Diagnosis: Pharmacologic mydriasis; Adie (tonic) pupil; Third‑order (postganglionic) Horner syndrome
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: pilocarpine (dilute), cocaine 10% (topical), hydroxyamphetamine 1% (Paredrine), apraclonidine 0.5–1%
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up to ensure resolution of the symptoms is reasonable.
Patient Education: Reassure patient that no treatment is required for pharmacologic mydriasis, explain that the dilated pupil is caused by topical medication exposure (eye drops) and typically resolves as the drug wears off, advise to avoid further exposure to unknown eye or facial products and to protect the affected eye from glare/light (sunglasses) and report any new symptoms (increasing pain, vision loss, drooping, double vision, or persistent dilation beyond expected duration). Recommend follow-up with eye care provider to confirm resolution and seek urgent care if neurologic symptoms (severe headache, weakness, numbness) develop.


CASE 76 — Leukocoria
====================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Leukocoria
DURATION: 6 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 3-year-old boy referred for persistent right-eye poor vision and esotropia diagnosed at age 2; treated with sporadic full‑time patching of the left eye for ~6 months without improvement. Parents noted leukocoria of the left eye on examination. Current symptoms include 20/200 vision in the right eye and 20/30 in the left, 25Δ esotropia at distance and near, a 1+ right relative afferent pupillary defect, small crowded optic discs with double‑ring sign (more pronounced on the right). Past medical history notable only for weight and height at the 15th percentile. No family history of strabismus or amblyopia.
History Narrative: A 3-year-old boy is referred by another ophthalmologist. The child was diagnosed with esotropia and amblyopia in the right eye at age 2 years. The referring ophthalmologist prescribed full-time patching of the left eye, which was done sporadically for approximately 6 months. No improvement in the child’s vision was noted, prompting referral for a second opinion and treatment recommendations. The child’s medical history is notable for a weight and height in the 15th percentile, but is otherwise unremarkable. The review of systems is completely negative with the exception of the ophthalmologic complaints and there is no family history of strabismus or amblyopia. The patient is shown in ▶Fig. 85.1. Best-corrected visual acuity is 20/200 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Motility evaluation reveals an esotropia of 25 prism diopters at distance and at near with full ductions and versions. Pupillary testing reveals a 1 + relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the right eye. Cycloplegic refraction is +1.25 diopters in both eyes and initial evaluation of the posterior pole reveals a normal disc, macula, and vessels. The ophthalmologist is concerned by the presence of the RAPD and performs a more careful evaluation of the posterior pole. The disc of the right eye appears slightly pale. The vessels on the nerve are crowded. The disc diameter is small, and a double-ring sign is noted (▶Fig. 85.2a, b). The left disc is also slightly smaller than normal.
Symptom Onset: Age 2 years (diagnosed with esotropia and amblyopia; symptoms noted then)
Symptom Duration: Approximately 1 year (esotropia/amblyopia noted at age 2; now 3 years)
Progression: Progressive
Characteristics: Leukocoria; bilateral retinoblastoma (left > right); 3-year-old boy; esotropia and amblyopia history; 25Δ esotropia; right RAPD 1+; small crowded optic discs with double-ring sign (optic nerve hypoplasia features); vitreous seeding and exudative retinal detachment in affected eye; hereditary potential (recommend RB1 testing).


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: Leukocoria; esotropia; decreased vision in right eye (20/200) and left eye (20/30); relative afferent pupillary defect (right); small/crowded optic discs with double-ring sign; pale right optic disc; growth retardation (height and weight 15th percentile)
Prior Treatments: Full-time patching of the left eye (sporadically for ~6 months)
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — impaired depth perception and vision in the right eye (20/200) and leukocoria/poor vision in the left eye with likely treatment-related monocularity will limit activities requiring binocular vision; requires protective measures and rehabilitation.
Systemic Symptoms: Unremarkable except for low height and weight (15th percentile); review of systems otherwise negative.
Risk Factors: Hereditary RB1 germline mutation; family history of retinoblastoma (if present); young age (early childhood); bilateral disease; prior radiation exposure (general known risk); increased risk of secondary malignancies (soft‑tissue and bony sarcomas)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: This 3-year-old boy with a history of presumed amblyopia and esotropia presents with unilateral visual loss (OD 20/200, OS 20/30), a 1+ right RAPD, small crowded pale right optic disc with double-ring sign, and bilateral retinoblastoma on imaging (left > right) with vitreous seeding and exudative retinal detachment. MRI demonstrates bilateral optic nerve involvement concern and midline evaluation for associated CNS/endocrine abnormalities; endocrine testing revealed marked growth hormone deficiency. Diagnosis: bilateral retinoblastoma (left greater than right). Plan: urgent multidisciplinary management with enucleation of the more advanced left eye with long optic nerve segment, and chemotherapy ± focal therapies (laser/cryotherapy, plaque, intra-arterial/intravitreal as indicated) for the right eye, genetic testing for RB1 mutation, frequent examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months until age 5 if germline mutation present, long-term surveillance for secondary malignancies, and endocrinology follow-up for pituitary hormone deficiencies.
Primary Diagnosis: Bilateral retinoblastoma
Secondary Diagnoses: Esotropia; Amblyopia (right eye); Optic nerve hypoplasia; Growth hormone deficiency; Septo‑optic dysplasia; Small optic discs/bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia findings
Differential Diagnosis: Retinoblastoma; Coats’ disease; Persistent fetal vasculature (persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous); Optic nerve hypoplasia
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Increased risk of secondary malignancies (particularly soft-tissue and bony sarcomas), orbital recurrence after enucleation, optic nerve invasion with potential spread, vision loss/monocular status, endocrine abnormalities related to septo‑optic dysplasia (e.g., growth hormone and corticotrophin deficiency)


Plan
All Medications: steroids
All Procedures: exam under anesthesia; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and orbits; genetic testing for RB1; chemotherapy (intravenous, intra-arterial, periocular, intravitreal); laser therapy; cryotherapy; radioactive plaque therapy; enucleation; socket examinations (post-enucleation)
Follow-Up Instructions: Following local control of the right eye, examinations under anesthesia every 3–4 months until age 5 if RB1 germline mutation present; frequent examinations for several more years with annual eye exam thereafter; examine enucleated socket at each contralateral eye visit; long-term surveillance for secondary malignancies; protect remaining eye with polycarbonate safety glasses and provide eye‑safety education.
Patient Education: Protect the remaining (seeing) eye: wear polycarbonate safety glasses for all activities. Understand retinoblastoma treatment and follow-up: chemotherapy and focal treatments (laser/cryotherapy) or enucleation may be needed; genetic testing (RB1) guides prognosis. Attend frequent examinations under anesthesia (every 3–4 months until age 5 if germline RB1 positive, then regular long-term follow-up) to monitor for tumor recurrence. Be aware of increased lifetime risk of secondary malignancies (soft-tissue and bone sarcomas) with hereditary disease and maintain long-term surveillance. Seek prompt care for any new eye symptoms and coordinate care with oncology/genetics and, if indicated, endocrinology.
Referrals: Endocrinology consultation (endocrinologist) and referral to pediatrician for endocrine testing; Ophthalmology surgical oncology/retinoblastoma specialist (for EUA, imaging, chemotherapy/enucleation)


CASE 77 — The Child Who Sees Poorly Out of One Eye
==================================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left eye looks “funny”/white pupil (leukocoria) noticed for 3 months.
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Left
PATIENT QUOTES: "funny"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The family of a 9‑month‑old girl noted that her left eye had looked “funny” for the last 3 months; pediatrician detected leukocoria and referred her to an ophthalmologist. The child is otherwise healthy, born 2 weeks prematurely (birth weight 6 lb 8 oz), with no systemic disease, animal exposure, or family history of childhood ocular disease. On exam she fixes and follows with the right eye but not the left; right posterior pole visible only; left eye has a white vascular lesion with large serous retinal detachment. Strong objection to occlusion of the right eye.
History Narrative: The family of a 9-month-old girl noted that her left eye has looked “funny” for the last 3 months. The girl’s pediatrician detected leukocoria and immediately referred her to an ophthalmologist for evaluation and treatment. The child is an otherwise healthy 9-month-old with a negative review of systems with the exception of the white pupil. She was born 2 weeks prematurely and had a birth weight of 6 lb., 8 oz. There is no history of systemic disease or exposure to animals, and there is no family history of childhood ocular disease. Examination reveals a normal right eye, though only the posterior pole can be seen on retinal examination. In the left eye, a white, vascular lesion is obvious with a surrounding large serous retinal detachment. The child fixes and follows well with her right eye, but does not fix or follow with her left eye. Strong objection to occlusion of the right eye is noted.
Symptom Onset: 3 months prior (onset at ~6 months of age)
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Characteristics: Unilateral leukocoria with a white vascular intraocular mass and large serous retinal detachment in the left eye; normal-appearing right eye with a small inferior retinal tumor; child fixes/follows with right eye only; onset noted at ~6 months (3 months prior to presentation).


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: white pupil (leukocoria), poor fixation/following of left eye, strong objection to occlusion of right eye

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Anisometropic amblyopia of the right eye secondary to uncorrected hyperopia. Child is 9 months old with leukocoria in the left eye found to have a large vascular intraocular tumor with serous retinal detachment consistent with retinoblastoma in the left eye; small tumor present in the inferior retina of the right eye. Right eye fixes and follows; left eye does not. Plan: urgent tumor workup and management for presumed left retinoblastoma (MRI of brain and orbits to assess extraocular/CNS spread, ultrasound B-/A-scan), genetic counseling and RB1 testing, evaluation of siblings/parents. For amblyopia management: prescribe full cycloplegic refraction (or symmetrically reduced hyperopic correction) and begin spectacle correction; consider atropine penalization if poor adaptation to spectacles; initiate occlusion therapy of the sound eye as indicated (start with 2 hours/day for mild–moderate amblyopia) and close follow-up with repeated exams under anesthesia as needed. Monitor for treatment response and adjust refractive correction and patching; consider surgical options only if media opacity or refractory anisometropia after conservative therapy.
Primary Diagnosis: Anisometropic amblyopia in the right eye due to uncorrected hyperopia
Secondary Diagnoses: Anisometropic amblyopia (right eye) due to uncorrected hyperopia; Hyperopia (refractive error)
Differential Diagnosis: Retinoblastoma; Coats’ disease; Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV); Toxocariasis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: right eye


Plan
All Medications: atropine eye drops (topical atropine)
All Procedures: occlusion therapy (eye patching) spectacle correction (cycloplegic refraction with hyperopic correction) atropine penalization (atropine eye drops for cycloplegia/optical penalization) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head and orbits B-scan and A-scan ultrasonography examination of eyes under anesthesia ( EUA ) enucleation (pathologic examination of enucleated eye ) genetic testing/counseling (RB1 testing) bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation (select cases) strabismus surgery (if indicated after amblyopia treatment) refractive surgery options (PRK, LASIK, clear lens extraction)
Follow-Up Instructions: Ophthalmologic follow-up examinations as needed after amblyopia treatment, with regular monitoring of refractive error and visual acuity (maintenance patching may be needed until age 7–8 years to prevent recurrence)
Patient Education: Explain leukocoria is a serious sign needing urgent evaluation; retinoblastoma is a possible cause and requires prompt imaging (MRI of brain/orbits) and specialist care. For amblyopia: correct refractive error with prescribed glasses (full cycloplegic or symmetric reduced hyperopic correction), consider atropine drops to aid adaptation, and treat with occlusion (patching) of the sound eye (often 2 hours/day for mild–moderate cases) or optical penalization if needed. Emphasize close follow-up to monitor vision, refractive changes, and adherence; genetic testing/counseling is recommended if retinoblastoma is diagnosed; seek immediate care for any new white pupil, eye misalignment, or loss of fixation.
Referrals: Immediate referral to an ophthalmologist (urgent) and genetic counseling/testing for retinoblastoma (RB1)

Plan
All Medications: 1% cyclopentolate
All Procedures: vision screening cycloplegic refraction (cycloplegia with 1% cyclopentolate) HOTV acuity testing Allen figure testing Titmus fly stereo testing motility evaluation (ductions/versions) vertical/horizontal prism dissociation (fixation preference testing) vertical prism correction inferior oblique myectomy inferior oblique recession superior oblique tuck strabismus surgery (rectus muscle surgery as adjunct) occlusion (patching) for amblyopia
Follow-Up Instructions: Parents should be advised at the time of surgery of the potential for over‑ or under‑correction and need for additional surgery in the future; children should undergo periodic ophthalmologic evaluations with attention to fusion, stereopsis, and visual acuity testing to detect, prevent, and treat amblyopia.
Patient Education: Explain torticollis and its causes (muscular vs ocular), focusing on superior oblique palsy: why the head tilt occurs and how it helps vision. Describe the proposed management plan: glasses for refractive error, observation for mild/symptomatic cases, possible vertical prism if small hypertropia and symptomatic, and surgery (inferior oblique weakening or superior oblique tuck) if needed to improve head posture, fusion, or diplopia. Explain risks/benefits of surgery, including possible need for additional procedures and temporary or persistent limitations in eye movement (Brown’s syndrome). Emphasize monitoring for amblyopia in young children: need for regular visual acuity and stereo/fusion checks, and prompt treatment (patching/optical correction) if amblyopia develops. Advise parents on signs to watch for (worsening head tilt, double vision, decreased vision in one eye, eye-turn, facial asymmetry) and to return for follow-up if noted. Provide practical guidance: ensure child wears prescribed glasses consistently, encourage compliance with any patching, and schedule regular ophthalmology visits.

Follow-Up Instructions: Periodic ophthalmological screening examinations to monitor for progressive corneal opacification, cataract, and glaucoma; abdominal ultrasounds at regular intervals until ~3 years of age for Wilms tumor surveillance (with MRI and biopsy if abnormalities found); early childhood educational intervention and low-vision evaluation.
Patient Education: Discuss aniridia including cause, risk of associated conditions (WAGR syndrome, Wilms’ tumor), and potential eye complications (photophobia, corneal opacification/vascularization, cataract, glaucoma, foveal hypoplasia leading to reduced vision and nystagmus). Advise protective measures (sunglasses or shaded contact lenses) for light sensitivity. Explain need for regular ophthalmology follow-up for glaucoma screening and monitoring of cornea and lens, and that surgery is high-risk and reserved for refractory problems. Recommend periodic abdominal ultrasounds until ~3 years of age to screen for Wilms’ tumor (with MRI/biopsy and oncology referral if abnormalities found). Emphasize early low-vision evaluation and educational/intervention services to support visual development.
Referrals: Pediatric oncology (if Wilms’ tumor confirmed) and referral for biopsy/pediatric oncologist consultation; periodic ophthalmology follow-up; low-vision evaluation and early childhood educational intervention; abdominal ultrasound surveillance with pediatric radiology (and MRI if ultrasound abnormality)


CASE 80 — Retinopathy of Prematurity
====================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: “jiggling eyes” and large pupils noted during the first month of life; decreased vision/does not see as well as siblings
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "jiggling eyes" "closes his eyes in bright sunlight" "does not appear to see as well as his two older siblings"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 9-month-old boy referred for “jiggling eyes” and large pupils noted during first month of life; parents report photophobia (closes eyes in bright sunlight) and apparent reduced vision compared with siblings; born at term with prenatal care and no perinatal complications; medical history notable for hypospadias repair 2 months earlier and developmental delay.
History Narrative: A 9-month-old boy was referred for eye evaluation because of “jiggling eyes” and large pupils first noted during the first month of life. He closes his eyes in bright sunlight and appears to have poorer vision compared with his two older siblings. He was born at term with prenatal care and no perinatal complications. Medical history includes hypospadias repair 2 months earlier and developmental delay. There is no family history of ophthalmologic or medical problems; his parents and two older siblings have normal eye exams. On exam he fixates and follows but with abnormal fixation and a low-amplitude, high-frequency horizontal pendular nystagmus. There is peripheral corneal opacification and vascularization, a markedly hypoplastic iris with only a small peripheral remnant, and bilateral anterior pyramidal cataracts. Retinal exam shows absence of an obvious umbo or foveal pigmentation. Genetic testing demonstrated a deletion of 11p13.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Type I retinopathy of prematurity in both eyes (zone/stage meeting treatment threshold), severe ROP requiring treatment; plan for prompt therapy with intravitreal anti‑VEGF (bevacizumab) or laser photocoagulation, frequent follow‑up until disease regression and continued screening up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age for possible late reactivation; counsel regarding risk of amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors; coordinate care with neonatology and arrange ophthalmic follow‑up and genetic/pediatric evaluation as indicated.
Primary Diagnosis: Retinopathy of prematurity (Type I, both eyes)
Secondary Diagnoses: Retinopathy of prematurity; developmental delay; hypospadias (post-repair); nystagmus; anterior pyramidal cataracts; corneal opacification/vascularization; iris hypoplasia/aniridia; foveal hypoplasia; risk of Wilms’ tumor (11p13 deletion)
Differential Diagnosis: Aniridia (congenital PAX6-related); WAGR syndrome-associated ocular anomalies; Persistent fetal vasculature with anterior segment dysgenesis
Severity: Type I
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: retinal detachment; posterior retinal fold; cataract; subretinal hemorrhage; intraretinal hemorrhage; vitreous hemorrhage; severe myopia; amblyopia; strabismus; severe refractive error (myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia)


Plan
All Medications: bevacizumab
All Procedures: intravitreal injection of bevacizumab laser photocoagulation (peripheral retinal photocoagulation) cryotherapy
Follow-Up Instructions: Frequent ophthalmic examinations until disease regression; continuous screening up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age for those treated with bevacizumab; ongoing monitoring for amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors.
Patient Education: Explain retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in simple terms: premature birth can cause abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina that can threaten vision. Describe the diagnosis and severity (Type I, both eyes) and that treatment options include laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (bevacizumab), which aim to stop abnormal vessels and preserve vision. Emphasize the need for frequent follow-up exams until the disease has fully regressed and longer monitoring (up to 60–70 weeks postmenstrual age) after anti-VEGF due to possible late reactivation. Review possible complications and long‑term risks: retinal detachment, cataract, hemorrhage, and higher rates of severe myopia after laser; unknown long‑term systemic/ocular effects after anti‑VEGF. Advise monitoring for other vision problems common in preterm children (amblyopia, strabismus, refractive errors) and need for regular ophthalmic care, glasses, patching or surgery if indicated. Recommend coordination with the pediatrician for overall health and developmental follow‑up; if ROP is sporadic, discuss genetic counseling only if other concerns arise. Provide clear emergency signs to return immediately: sudden redness, discharge, swelling, acute changes in eye appearance or eye movements, or a sudden decline in visual behavior.
Referrals: Geneticist and pediatrician

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Infantile esotropia status post prior strabismus surgery with recurrent esotropia. Left-eye dissociated vertical deviation and bilateral inferior oblique overaction are present. Left-eye amblyopia. Recommend full cycloplegic refraction and new spectacles, recheck alignment in a few months to assess for accommodative component; consider bifocals only if fusion/stereopsis documented. If residual esotropia >10–12 PD at distance in full correction, surgical correction (options: bilateral medial rectus recession, medial rectus recession with lateral rectus resection, or bilateral lateral rectus resection based on measurements and prior surgery) is indicated. Monitor vision and alignment regularly; treat amblyopia as needed and repeat surgery if deviation recurs.
Primary Diagnosis: Infantile esotropia status post strabismus surgery, now with recurrent esotropia
Secondary Diagnoses: Infantile esotropia status post strabismus surgery; recurrent esotropia; dissociated vertical deviation OS; bilateral inferior oblique overaction; left amblyopia; retinopathy of prematurity (zone I, type I with plus disease); history of extreme prematurity, sepsis, respiratory compromise, necrotizing enterocolitis, anemia of prematurity
Differential Diagnosis: Infantile (congenital) esotropia; Accommodative esotropia; Third‑nerve (oculomotor) palsy with medial rectus overaction
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: recurrent esotropia; dissociated vertical deviation (left); bilateral inferior oblique overaction; amblyopia (left); potential recurrence of amblyopia and/or esotropia; need for repeat strabismus surgery; risks related to ROP (retinal detachment, visual impairment/blindness)


Plan
All Medications: intravenous antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, bevacizumab, spectacles (glasses), bifocals, cycloplegic refraction (cycloplegic agent)
All Procedures: strabismus surgery (prior) — unspecified procedure(s) for infantile esotropia; bilateral medial rectus recession (as possible surgical option); medial rectus recession with ipsilateral lateral rectus resection (option); bilateral lateral rectus resection (option); prescription of full cycloplegic spectacle correction; amblyopia treatment (patching/visual therapy)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow up in the next few months to recheck ocular alignment with new full cycloplegic spectacle correction; monitor vision for amblyopia and adjust treatment as needed, perform regular childhood follow-ups (intervals based on angle stability, visual acuity, and age), and consider surgery if residual esotropia >10–12 PD at distance with full correction.
Patient Education: Provide full cycloplegic spectacle correction and return for follow-up to monitor alignment and vision; if orthotropic at distance but esotropic at near and fusion/stereopsis present, consider bifocals; monitor for and treat amblyopia as needed; if residual esotropia >10–12 PD at distance with full correction, discuss strabismus surgery options (medial rectus recession ± lateral rectus surgery); schedule regular childhood follow-ups for recurrence and stereopsis monitoring.


CASE 82 — Childhood Exotropia
=============================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Recurrent inward drift of the left eye (intermittent esotropia), noted especially when tired
DURATION: 5 years
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 5-year-old girl with crossed eyes since 2 months of age, with strabismus surgery at 8 months. Eyes were well aligned after surgery until recently when the left eye intermittently drifts inward, especially when tired. Never treated with occlusion therapy. Current glasses at least 1 year old. No other medical issues. Family history: sister with esotropia requiring surgery. Visual acuity with current correction 20/30 OD, 20/50 OS. Current spectacles +2.00 OD, +2.50 OS.
History Narrative: A 5-year-old girl with a history of crossed eyes since 2 months of age presents for an examination. She has a history of strabismus surgery at 8 months of age. Her mother reports that her eyes were well aligned following surgery until recently when her left eye has been noted to intermittently drift inward, especially when she is tired. She has never been treated with occlusion therapy. Her current glasses are at least 1 year old. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The family history is notable for a sister with esotropia that required surgical intervention.
Symptom Onset: 2 months of age
Symptom Duration: Since 2 months of age
Progression: Intermittent, worsening (increased frequency of inward drift, noted recently)
Characteristics: Intermittent exotropia — pseudodivergence excess type; intermittent outward deviation with poor fusional control, better at distance than near (pseudodivergence pattern), lifelong tendency, associated with reduced stereopsis (3000″), asymmetric OKN, may have inferior oblique overaction, V‑pattern, dissociated vertical deviation.


Subjective (cont.)
Aggravating Factors: tiredness
Alleviating Factors: When she is tired, the left eye drifts inward less—eyes are better aligned after prior surgery; improved alignment with spectacle correction (full hyperopic correction likely to help).
Associated Symptoms: Intermittent inward drifting of the left eye (worse when tired)
Previous Episodes: Yes — crossed eyes noted since 2 months of age; surgery at 8 months; eyes well aligned until recently when intermittent inward drift began.
Prior Treatments: Strabismus surgery at 8 months of age
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild — intermittent symptoms (worse when tired) with preserved functional vision (20/30 OD, 20/50 OS) allowing most daily activities with occasional difficulty in prolonged near tasks and reduced stereopsis.
Systemic Symptoms: None reported
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: Sister with esotropia that required surgical intervention
Risk Factors: Family history of strabismus (sister with esotropia); early-onset strabismus (onset at 2 months); prior strabismus surgery; uncorrected/undercorrected hyperopia.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Pseudodivergence excess type intermittent exotropia. The patient is a 5-year-old girl with early-onset intermittent exotropia, asymmetric OKN suggestive of early-onset etiology, moderate inferior oblique overaction bilaterally with a V-pattern, moderate left dissociated vertical deviation, reduced stereoacuity (3000″ on Titmus), hyperopia undercorrected on current glasses (+3.00 OD, +3.75 OS cycloplegic), and intermittent exotropia greater at near (20 PD) than distance (8 PD). Management options include full hyperopic spectacle correction and observation/medical therapies (occlusion or orthoptic exercises as appropriate), with surgical intervention considered if control worsens.
Primary Diagnosis: Pseudodivergence excess type intermittent exotropia
Secondary Diagnoses: Intermittent exotropia (pseudodivergence excess type), inferior oblique overaction OU, V‑pattern strabismus, dissociated vertical deviation OS, amblyopia OS (reduced VA 20/50), high hyperopia OU (cycloplegic +3.00 OD, +3.75 OS), asymmetric OKN (nasal‑to‑temporal deficit)
Differential Diagnosis: Infantile (congenital) esotropia; Partially accommodative (refractive) esotropia; Sensory esotropia; Sixth nerve palsy (acquired/paralytic)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Recurrence of exotropia (20–40%); decreased stereopsis; amblyopia; need for repeat surgery; cosmetic/psychosocial concerns


Plan
All Medications: cyclopentolate, homatropine, scopolamine, atropine
All Procedures: Strabismus surgery (prior at 8 months of age); potential future procedures discussed: bilateral lateral rectus recessions, lateral rectus recession with ipsilateral medial rectus resection, bilateral medial rectus resections.
Follow-Up Instructions: If managed medically: follow-up every 2–6 months for reevaluation. If surgery performed: healing ~6 weeks, with continued long-term follow-up (monitor for recurrence, decreasing stereopsis, and amblyopia).
Patient Education: Intermittent exotropia is a lifelong condition caused by difficulty the brain has with fusing the two eyes’ images; it may improve or be controlled but is not “cured.” Management options include updating full hyperopic eyeglass correction, passive measures (patching/overminus glasses) for young children, and active convergence exercises (e.g., pencil push-ups) once the child can cooperate. Surgery is considered if control becomes poor or the eye drifts outward much of the time; recurrence after surgery is possible. Regular follow-up is important to monitor control, stereopsis, and for development of amblyopia so treatment can be adjusted promptly.


CASE 83 — Childhood Ptosis
==========================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: intermittent drifting out of the right eye for 2 years
DURATION: 2 years
LATERALITY: right
PATIENT QUOTES: "the eye is now deviated outward approximately 60% of the day." "right eye closure in sunlight."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 4-year-old boy with a 2-year history of intermittent right-eye outward drifting, worse when tired or looking at distance, initially occurring 2–3 times/day but recently present ~60% of the day, with deviation up to ~50–60Δ at distance, worse in sunlight causing right eye closure, no trauma or systemic symptoms.
History Narrative: A 4-year-old boy presents with a 2-year history of intermittent drifting out of the right eye. His mother states that the deviation is worse when the child is tired or when he is looking at distant objects. His mother initially noted this deviation approximately two to three times a day; however, it recently has been getting worse. She states that the eye is now deviated outward approximately 60% of the day. There is no history of antecedent head trauma, febrile episode, or other medical problem. There is no family history of strabismus or amblyopia. Review of systems is notable for right eye closure in sunlight.
Symptom Onset: 2 years prior (onset at age 2)

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid with anomalous chin‑up head posture and absence of amblyopia.
Primary Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis of the right upper lid with anomalous chin-up head posture and absence of amblyopia
Differential Diagnosis: Intermittent exotropia (pseudodivergence excess type); Congenital exotropia; Third nerve palsy; Myasthenia gravis
Laterality: Right
Complications: early and late infection; suture granuloma; exposure keratopathy; retrobulbar hemorrhage; overcorrections


Plan
All Procedures: Patch test; Cycloplegic refraction; Alternate cover testing (simultaneous prism and cover as indicated); 30-minute occlusion (patch) test; Occlusion therapy for amblyopia; Pharmacologic or optical penalization for amblyopia; Fasanella–Servat procedure; Levator resection; Frontalis suspension (using autogenous fascia lata, banked fascia lata, silicone rod, Supramid/nylon/Prolene/Gore-Tex sutures, or palmaris longus tendon); Surgical reduction of levator (levator surgery)
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow the child throughout childhood for surveillance of amblyopia and anisometropia until at least age 7–10; after ptosis surgery, expect ~1 month healing with nighttime lubrication for ~1 month (longer if Bell’s reflex absent) and monitor lid height for recurrence.
Patient Education: Congenital ptosis is a condition present from birth causing drooping of the upper eyelid; it can affect vision and head posture. Key points: - Watch for amblyopia (lazy eye) and unequal refractive error (anisometropia); regular eye exams and vision testing are important through at least age 7–10. - Treatment options: - Non-surgical: glasses if significant refractive error; patching or penalization if amblyopia develops. - Surgical: recommended if ptosis significantly blocks vision or causes chin-up head posture. Procedures depend on levator muscle function (levator resection for mild–moderate cases; frontalis suspension for severe cases with poor levator function). Discuss risks (infection, exposure keratopathy, overcorrection) and materials (autogenous fascia lata has best long-term results). - After surgery: expect about 1 month for healing, temporary incomplete eyelid closure during sleep—use lubricating drops/ointment at night initially; long-term lubrication may be needed if Bell’s phenomenon is poor. - Follow-up: regular postoperative visits to monitor lid height and vision; lifelong monitoring in childhood to detect recurrent ptosis or recurrent amblyopia. Seek prompt care for redness, sudden vision change, severe pain, or wound issues.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: A 17-month-old boy with congenital right upper‑lid ptosis since birth. External exam: moderate–severe right ptosis with R palpebral fissure 6.5 mm vs L 10 mm; MRD1 R 0.5 mm, L 3.5 mm (improves to 2 mm R with chin‑up posture); levator function R 6 mm, L 12 mm; absent right lid crease. Pupils equal, reactive, no APD. Full versions, orthotropic. Cycloplegic refraction essentially plano with minimal anisometropia (R −0.25 +1.50 ×90, L +0.50). Normal fixation and following OU with no fixation preference. Findings (absent lid crease, increased fissure in downgaze, chin‑up posture, moderate levator function) are consistent with congenital (simple) ptosis. No evidence of Horner syndrome, third‑nerve palsy, jaw‑wink, myasthenia, or associated ocular motility or neurologic abnormalities. Vision currently equal and not amblyopic; no surgical intervention indicated at this time. Recommend periodic developmental/neurologic surveillance and routine ocular follow‑up to monitor for amblyopia or refractive changes.
Primary Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis
Differential Diagnosis: Congenital ptosis (levator dysgenesis); Horner syndrome; Third cranial nerve palsy; Marcus Gunn jaw-winking ptosis
Severity: Moderate to severe
Laterality: Right
Complications: amblyopia


Plan
All Procedures: exam under anesthesia, funduscopy, refraction, corneal diameter measurement, measurement of intraocular pressure, cycloplegic refraction, slit-lamp examination, electrophysiologic testing, neuroimaging
Follow-Up Instructions: For isolated DVM: monitor developmental and neurologic status with periodic pediatric assessments; expect vision normalization by 6–8 months—if vision does not improve by 6–8 months, obtain electrophysiologic testing and neuroimaging. If associated neurologic/developmental abnormalities, continue follow-up as vision may improve up to 1–2 years.
Patient Education: This right upper‑lid droop (congenital ptosis) has been present since birth and is most consistent with a developmental under‑development of the levator muscle. Because your child fixates and follows well in both eyes and has only minimal refractive difference, immediate surgery is not indicated. Watchful follow‑up is recommended: monitor vision and development closely, have routine pediatric and ophthalmic exams to detect any amblyopia (lazy eye), significant refractive error, or changes in eyelid function, and return sooner if you notice worsening drooping, abnormal eye movements, unequal pupil sizes, or signs of developmental delay. If vision does not remain normal by about 6–8 months of age (or later if neurologic issues are present), further testing (electrophysiology, neuroimaging) will be recommended.


CASE 85 — Optic Nerve Hypoplasia
================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: May be blind; poor eye contact and not responding to bright lights
DURATION: 3 months
LATERALITY: Bilateral
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 3-month-old girl brought by parents for concern she may be blind; parents report poor eye contact, lack of response to parental facial expressions, and apparent unresponsiveness to bright lights. Prenatal and birth histories unremarkable. No prior ophthalmologic or medical problems. Two older siblings had normal visual responses at comparable age. Development otherwise normal. Parents note she does blink to bright light; occasional OKN beat but attention poor. No spontaneous nystagmus; eyes orthotropic with full versions. Pupils 5 mm, moderately reactive, no afferent pupillary defect. Anterior segment and fundus exams normal. Parents requested VEP testing.
History Narrative: A 3-month-old girl is brought to her ophthalmologist by her parents because of concerns that she may be blind. They report that she has poor eye contact, that she does not respond to parental facial expressions, and that she does not appear to respond to bright lights. The child’s prenatal and birth histories are unremarkable. Her past ophthalmologic and medical histories are unremarkable. The child has two siblings, aged 2 years and 5 years, who visually responded much more at 3 months of age than the patient does and who are developmentally and visually normal at this time. The review of systems is otherwise negative. The child appears to be normal from a developmental standpoint, though the child has not been seen by her pediatrician in several weeks.
Symptom Onset: 3 months of age
Symptom Duration: 3 months
Progression: Stable to potentially progressive endocrine issues; visual impairment may improve with maturation or amblyopia therapy but optic nerve hypoplasia is a nonprogressive structural defect.
Characteristics: Bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia associated with septo‑optic dysplasia, growth hormone deficiency (short stature, low weight), absence of septum pellucidum, small optic nerve with double‑ring sign, potential for nystagmus and variable vision ranging from severe impairment to normal.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: poor eye contact; failure to fixate or follow; no response to facial expressions; does not respond to bright lights; occasional nystagmus on OKN; blinks to bright light; orthotropic eyes; pupils 5 mm moderately reactive; normal anterior segment and fundus

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Septo-optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia. The child also has growth hormone deficiency resulting in short stature and low weight.
Primary Diagnosis: Septo-optic dysplasia with bilateral, asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia
Secondary Diagnoses: Septo-optic dysplasia; bilateral asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia; growth hormone deficiency (pituitary hormone deficiency)
Differential Diagnosis: Delayed visual maturation; Cortical visual impairment; Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia/structural optic nerve abnormality
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: Septo‑optic dysplasia with bilateral asymmetric optic nerve hypoplasia; growth hormone deficiency leading to short stature and low weight; risk of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies; potential amblyopia and poor vision/severe visual impairment; strabismus (esotropia) with higher recurrence after surgery; increased risk of endocrine abnormalities presenting later; need for lifelong endocrine monitoring; risk to better-seeing eye (functional monocular) requiring protective eyewear.


Plan
All Medications: pituitary hormone replacement as needed; corticosteroids (stress-dose)
Follow-Up Instructions: Ongoing evaluation of growth and endocrine parameters throughout early childhood with endocrinology follow-up; administer stress-dose corticosteroids if corticotrophin deficiency suspected during acute illness/surgery; continue amblyopia therapy and defer strabismus surgery until amblyopia maximized (typically postpone surgery until school age); prescribe polycarbonate safety spectacles to protect the better-seeing eye.
Patient Education: Explain optic nerve hypoplasia and its variable vision outcomes; reassure that visual maturation may improve over months and avoid labeling as permanently visually impaired in infancy; emphasize need for endocrinology evaluation and ongoing pituitary hormone testing and replacement as needed; discuss possible neuroimaging if indicated; advise trial of amblyopia therapy before assuming irreversible loss and that strabismus surgery is usually delayed until amblyopia treatment is maximized and often until school age; recommend protective polycarbonate eyewear for the better-seeing eye; instruct parents about lifelong growth and endocrine follow-up (including possible delayed hormone deficiencies) and stress-dose steroids if corticotrophin deficiency is present during illness or surgery; coordinate care with pediatrician, neurologist, and endocrinologist and provide clear counseling to alleviate parental concerns.
Referrals: Endocrinology (pituitary/hormone evaluation)
Emergency Instructions: Stress doses of corticosteroids should be administered in situations such as acute illness, surgery, or serious injury for patients with corticotrophin abnormalities.


CASE 86 — Ptosis
================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Enlarging right upper eyelid skin nodule with eyelid droop (ptosis)
LATERALITY: Bilateral
PATIENT QUOTES: "N/A"
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 55-year-old man with an approximately 8-month history of an enlarging, fairly rapidly growing skin nodule of the right upper eyelid near the medial canthal region, with one episode of bleeding after picking at the lesion; extensive sun-exposure history; no prior skin cancer.
History Narrative: A 55-year-old man presented for evaluation of an enlarging skin nodule of his right upper eyelid. The lesion had been present for approximately 8 months and had grown fairly rapidly. The patient recalled one episode of bleeding from the area after he had picked at the lesion. While there was no previous history of skin cancer, the patient reported an extensive sun-exposure history. His ophthalmic examination was within normal limits except for the external examination. There was a large elevated nonpigmented nodule involving the skin of the right upper eyelid near the medial canthal region. The nodule measured approximately 15 mm × 12 mm × 7 mm and showed numerous small telangiectatic vessels on its surface. The edges of the tumor had a thickened pearly appearance. There was no ulceration present. The skin underlying the lesion was freely moveable, and the tumor did not appear fixed to the underlying deep structures. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. The skin of the patient’s face showed diffuse sun-exposure changes consisting of fine wrinkles and telangiectatic vessels and scattered areas of crusting.
Symptom Onset: Approximately 8 months prior
Symptom Duration: 8 months
Progression: Enlarging over ~8 months (fairly rapid growth)
Characteristics: Droopiness of the upper eyelids due to levator aponeurosis disinsertion (aponeurotic ptosis)


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: taping of the lid or the use of eyelid crutches attached to spectacles
Associated Symptoms: visual field impairment
Previous Episodes: One episode of bleeding after picking at the lesion

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Ptosis of both upper eyelids due to levator aponeurosis disinsertion, causing superior visual field impairment; patient underwent bilateral external levator advancement with intraoperative adjustment under local anesthesia, resulting in improved visual field without complications.
Primary Diagnosis: Ptosis of both upper eyelids due to levator aponeurosis disinsertion
Differential Diagnosis: Basal cell carcinoma; Squamous cell carcinoma; Sebaceous gland carcinoma; Malignant melanoma
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral
Complications: undercorrection; overcorrection; asymmetric or unsatisfactory lid contour; lagophthalmos with exposure symptoms


Plan
All Procedures: External levator advancement on both upper eyelids
Follow-Up Instructions: Postoperative monitoring of eyelid height and contour; report any signs of infection, wound dehiscence, increasing pain, vision changes, or exposure symptoms; routine postoperative visit for suture removal and intraoperative-adjustment assessment (typically within 1 week) with additional follow-up as needed for symmetry, under/overcorrection, or lagophthalmos.
Patient Education: Ptosis is a drooping of the upper eyelid most often caused by age-related loosening of the levator aponeurosis. If mild and not affecting vision, no treatment is needed; temporary measures include taping the lid or using an eyelid crutch on glasses. If the droop interferes with your superior peripheral vision or daily activities, surgical repair (levator advancement or Müller’s muscle procedure) can restore eyelid position. Surgery risks include under- or overcorrection, asymmetric contour, or incomplete eyelid closure leading to dryness; these are usually manageable. After surgery, you may have improved visual fields and should follow wound care instructions, attend postoperative visits for lid position adjustment, and report any persistent double vision, severe pain, redness, or vision changes promptly.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Thyroid eye disease (Graves’ orbitopathy) manifesting with bilateral eyelid retraction and proptosis causing exposure symptoms. Vision 20/20 OU, orthophoric with full motility, no compressive optic neuropathy or significant diplopia. Managed conservatively with lubricants and punctal occlusion; underwent four‑lid recession after 4 months of stability with good cosmetic and symptomatic outcome. Associated hypothyroidism on thyroid hormone replacement.
Primary Diagnosis: Thyroid eye disease (Graves’ orbitopathy) with eyelid retraction and bilateral proptosis
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypothyroidism
Differential Diagnosis: Aponeurotic ptosis; Neurogenic ptosis (eg, Horner’s syndrome, myasthenia gravis); Myogenic ptosis (eg, oculopharyngeal dystrophy, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia); Mechanical ptosis
Severity: Severe
Laterality: Bilateral


Plan
All Medications: artificial tears; lubricating ointment (bedtime); topical intraocular pressure–lowering drops; prednisone (oral corticosteroid) 80–100 mg daily; intravenous pulsed high-dose steroids; orbital radiation therapy (alternative); thyroid hormone replacement therapy
All Procedures: frequent artificial tears; punctal occlusion; four‑lid recession (recession of all four eyelids)
Follow-Up Instructions: Maintain thyroid hormone replacement and routine endocrinology follow-up; use frequent artificial tears and punctal occlusion for corneal lubrication; return for postoperative follow-up after eyelid recessions and report any vision changes, diplopia, increased redness, pain, or worsening exposure.
Patient Education: Thyroid eye disease (Graves’ orbitopathy) can cause bulging eyes, eyelid retraction, dry or exposed corneas, double vision, and rarely optic nerve problems. Treatment depends on severity and activity: mild cases often need lubricating eye drops/ointments, eyelid measures (moisture shields at night, punctal occlusion) and IOP drops if needed; active inflammation or vision threat may require high‑dose steroids, orbital radiation, or urgent orbital decompression. Rehabilitative surgery (orbital decompression, strabismus surgery, eyelid repair) is done when inflammation is inactive and tailored to your symptoms. Report sudden vision loss, worsening double vision, severe pain, or new drooping immediately. Coordinate care with your endocrinologist to optimize thyroid hormone levels, and attend regular ophthalmology follow‑up for vision, eye pressure, and corneal health.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Involutional ectropion of the left lower eyelid causing poor punctal apposition and ocular surface irritation with inferior punctate epithelial erosions; diagnosis confirmed clinically and managed surgically (lateral tarsal strip with medial spindle) after conservative lubrication.
Primary Diagnosis: Involutional ectropion of the left lower eyelid
Differential Diagnosis: Graves’ (thyroid) orbitopathy; Idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital myositis); Bilateral orbital metastases/diffuse infiltrative disease (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left
Complications: dry eye with punctate epithelial erosions, corneal exposure/keratitis, tearing due to poor punctal apposition, conjunctival hypertrophy/keratinization, lagophthalmos-related exposure keratopathy


Plan
All Medications: artificial tears; lubricating ointment
All Procedures: lateral tarsal strip procedure; medial spindle procedure
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up in oculoplastics clinic in 1 week for wound check and suture removal as indicated, then at 6–8 weeks to assess eyelid position and symptom resolution; continue lubricating drops/ointment as needed; seek urgent care sooner for increasing pain, redness, discharge, vision loss, or wound dehiscence.
Patient Education: Lubricating eye drops during the day and ointment at night to protect the cornea and relieve grittiness; avoid dry or windy environments and use humidifiers as needed; protect eyes from sun with sunglasses; apply warm compresses and gentle eyelid hygiene if irritation occurs; attend follow-up appointments to monitor healing and report increased pain, vision changes, excessive tearing, or wound problems; surgical repair (lateral tarsal strip ± medial spindle) is effective for involutional ectropion if symptoms persist despite lubrication.
Referrals: Consultation with an internist or endocrinologist to evaluate thyroid status

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Dacryocystitis of the right lacrimal system secondary to nasolacrimal duct disruption from prior nasal surgery, presenting with acute infectious inflammation that responded to oral antibiotics. Resolved acute inflammation followed by dacryocystorhinostomy with silicone tube placement, resulting in good resolution of epiphora; ongoing follow-up with otolaryngology and oncology for underlying midline disease.
Primary Diagnosis: Dacryocystitis
Secondary Diagnoses: disrupted nasolacrimal duct from prior nasal surgery; entropion of the left lower eyelid; distichiasis; blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction; dry eye (tear film insufficiency)
Differential Diagnosis: Dacryocystitis secondary to nasolacrimal duct obstruction; Acute bacterial dacryocystitis with lacrimal sac abscess; Chronic dacryocystitis from canalicular or punctal stenosis
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: right
Complications: recurrence of infection/epiphora; chronic dacryocystitis; lacrimal sac abscess/pyocele; need for surgical intervention (DCR)


Plan
All Medications: oral antibiotics antibiotic ophthalmic drops silicone tubing

Patient Education: Apply warm compresses frequently to the inflamed area; complete the prescribed oral (or IV, if indicated) antibiotics as directed. Expect that most patients ultimately require dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) after infection resolves to prevent recurrence; surgery is usually deferred until the acute infection is controlled but may be performed sooner if infection persists. Ophthalmic antibiotic drops are of limited value. Follow-up with ENT and ophthalmology for postoperative care and ongoing management; report increasing pain, fever, spreading redness, or failure to improve promptly.
Referrals: ENT and oncology follow-up


CASE 92 — Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation
=========================================
Subjective
CHIEF COMPLAINT: tearing and pain of the right lower eyelid medially
DURATION: 48 hours
LATERALITY: Right
PATIENT QUOTES: "I have constant tearing from my right eye since the surgeries, and recently I've noticed intermittent redness of the right lower eyelid with tenderness and mucous discharge."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 44-year-old woman with constant right-sided epiphora since prior midfacial surgeries (including nasal septum removal and frontoethmoidectomies) who presented with tearing and medial right lower eyelid pain. More recently developed intermittent redness of the right lower eyelid with tenderness, mucous discharge, and whitish mucoid discharge expressed from the punctum; had been treated with topical antibiotic previously. Nasolacrimal irrigation showed distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction with patency of the proximal system. Conjunctiva mildly injected; no palpable lacrimal sac mass.
History Narrative: A 44-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of tearing and pain of the right lower eyelid medially. Her past medical history was significant for lethal midline granuloma (midfacial necrotizing lesion) for which she had undergone multiple procedures, including removal of the nasal septum and frontoethmoidectomies. She reported constant epiphora of the right eye since the time of her surgeries and had more recently noted intermittent redness of the right lower eyelid, associated with tenderness and mucous discharge from the eye. She had been previously treated with an unknown ophthalmic antibiotic drop. Examination showed erythema of the right lower lid medially with associated tenderness to palpation. No definite masses were palpated in the lacrimal sac region. There was a whitish mucoid discharge expressed from the punctum upon palpation of the lacrimal sac, and the conjunctiva was mildly injected. The puncta of the right upper and lower eyelid were present and appeared patent. There was a well-healed surgical incision over the nose with residual distortion of the nasal architecture. The remainder of the ophthalmic examination was completely normal. Nasolacrimal irrigation was performed and demonstrated complete obstruction of the distal nasal lacrimal system. The upper system was patent as demonstrated by the reflux of irrigating solution through the upper and lower puncta. Inspection of the inner nose showed a large nasal defect with an absent septum.
Symptom Onset: acute onset
Symptom Duration: intermittent (constant since surgeries) — chronic since prior midfacial surgeries; epiphora present continuously since surgeries, recent intermittent redness/tenderness (acute on chronic)
Progression: Resolved with treatment
Characteristics: Idiopathic orbital inflammation with associated scleritis and secondary choroidal effusion


Subjective (cont.)
Alleviating Factors: Systemic corticosteroid therapy (IV methylprednisolone then oral prednisone)
Associated Symptoms: tearing (epiphora), pain of right lower eyelid medially, intermittent redness of right lower eyelid, tenderness, mucous/whitish mucoid discharge, mild conjunctival injection
Previous Episodes: Recurrent episodes of dacryocystitis/epiphora since prior nasal surgeries (chronic, intermittent redness and tenderness)
Prior Treatments: multiple procedures including removal of the nasal septum and frontoethmoidectomies; previously treated with an unknown ophthalmic antibiotic drop
Impact on Daily Activities: Mild — able to perform usual activities after steroid treatment; temporary pain and vision changes initially limited function but resolved with therapy.
Systemic Symptoms: Afebrile; no systemic signs of infection; no evidence of collagen‑vascular disease; otherwise systemically well.
Contacts with Similar Symptoms: No known contacts with similar symptoms.
Risk Factors: Prior midfacial surgery and nasal/ethmoid surgery with resultant anatomic disruption (including absent nasal septum) leading to chronic nasolacrimal obstruction; prior infections/inflammation from underlying midline granulomatous disease (lethal midline granuloma) and chronic nasolacrimal stasis.

Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: methylprednisolone; prednisone; unknown ophthalmic antibiotic drop
All Procedures: nasolacrimal irrigation; dacryocystography (discussed as test); dacryoscintigraphy (discussed as test); passage of Bowman probe (mentioned as diagnostic maneuver); intravenous methylprednisolone administration; conversion to oral prednisone; orbital biopsy (stated as indicated if no improvement)
Follow-Up Instructions: Referred for systemic evaluation for collagen-vascular disease or lymphoma; slow taper of oral steroid therapy with outpatient follow-up and repeat MRI to exclude underlying neoplasm.
Patient Education: Explain idiopathic orbital inflammation (an inflammatory condition of the tissues around the eye), its typical sudden onset with pain and swelling, and common causes to rule out (infection, autoimmune disease, thyroid eye disease, or tumor). Reassure that rapid improvement with high‑dose corticosteroids is expected and is a hallmark of this diagnosis. Advise the patient about the steroid treatment plan: need for high‑dose IV steroids initially with transition to oral prednisone and a slow taper to prevent recurrence and reduce side effects. Discuss common steroid side effects (increased blood sugar, mood changes, insomnia, weight gain, fluid retention, elevated blood pressure, increased infection risk, and possible bone thinning with long courses) and the importance of monitoring (blood pressure, blood glucose, and bone health as appropriate). Instruct to report any new symptoms promptly (worsening vision, increased eye pain, fever, cough, or systemic symptoms). Explain the rationale for further testing and follow‑up: systemic evaluation for autoimmune disease or lymphoma, and follow‑up imaging (MRI) to exclude occult neoplasm if indicated. Advise avoiding abrupt steroid discontinuation and to follow prescribed taper; provide written instructions for dosing and taper schedule. Encourage routine ophthalmology follow‑up to monitor vision, inflammation, and steroid side effects.
Referrals: Systemic evaluation for collagen-vascular disease or lymphoma.

PATIENT QUOTES: "somewhat lethargic and continued to complain of pain around the right eye."
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 7-year-old boy with 4 days of right-sided eyelid swelling, pain, and fever; initially diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and started on oral antibiotics, with progression over 2 days to worsening right upper lid edema causing complete ptosis, lethargy, persistent periorbital pain, low-grade fever (100°F), conjunctival injection, decreased right eye motility, mild proptosis, and palpable preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy; no definite decreased vision.
History Narrative: A 7-year-old boy was referred for evaluation and treatment of right-sided eyelid swelling, pain, and fever that began 4 days earlier. He had no definite complaint of decreased vision. He was initially diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and started on oral antibiotics. Two days later his right upper lid edema progressed to complete ptosis despite antibiotics, and he was referred to a tertiary care center. On arrival he was somewhat lethargic, continuing to complain of right eye pain, and had a temperature of 100°F. Exam showed marked periorbital edema and erythema with complete right eyelid ptosis, enlarged preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes, diffuse conjunctival injection, decreased motility of the right globe in all directions, mild proptosis obscured by lid edema, normal pupillary reactions without relative afferent pupillary defect, quiet anterior segments, and a dilated fundus exam without significant abnormalities.
Symptom Onset: 4 days prior to presentation
Symptom Duration: 4 days
Progression: Progression of the right upper lid edema despite oral antibiotics over 2 days, leading to complete ptosis.
Characteristics: Inflammation and rapid enlargement of the lacrimal gland with eyelid erythema, edema (temporal upper eyelid), tenderness, possible conjunctival injection, regional lymphadenopathy, often unilateral, may cause S-shaped eyelid deformity and tearing; may be infectious (eg, EBV, bacterial), idiopathic, or neoplastic.


Subjective (cont.)
Associated Symptoms: Eyelid swelling, eye pain, fever, lethargy, ptosis (complete), periorbital edema and erythema, conjunctival injection, decreased ocular motility in all gazes, mild proptosis, regional lymphadenopathy, tearing (epiphora)
Previous Episodes: None
Prior Treatments: Oral antibiotics (initiated for presumed preseptal cellulitis)
Impact on Daily Activities: Moderate — significant eyelid edema, pain, ptosis, decreased ocular motility and lethargy limiting normal activities and school attendance for days; self-limited with expected recovery.
Systemic Symptoms: Fever of 100 °F; lethargy.
Risk Factors: Recent/acute Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection; prior mumps (historical); bacterial infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae); immunization status (lack of HiB/mumps vaccination historically increases related infections); adjacent sinusitis or local periocular infection allowing spread; systemic immunosuppression (inferred as general risk for infections).

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: Acute dacryoadenitis of the right lacrimal gland, clinically consistent with an acute inflammatory enlargement with eyelid erythema, edema, tenderness, "S-shaped" upper lid deformity and regional lymphadenopathy. Serologic testing positive for anti-EBV viral capsid antigen antibodies with negative anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibodies supports recent Epstein–Barr virus infection as the presumed etiology. No evidence of orbital involvement on clinical exam; management with anti-inflammatory therapy (topical or oral corticosteroids) and observation recommended; disease is typically self-limited.
Primary Diagnosis: Acute dacryoadenitis
Secondary Diagnoses: Epstein–Barr virus (acute EBV infection)
Differential Diagnosis: Acute dacryoadenitis (infectious—EBV or bacterial); Idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital pseudotumor) involving lacrimal gland; Lacrimal gland tumor (primary epithelial or metastatic)
Severity: Moderate
Laterality: Right


Plan
All Medications: oral antibiotics (unspecified), oxacillin (example penicillinase-resistant penicillin), topical or oral corticosteroid medication
Follow-Up Instructions: Follow-up for resolution of symptoms.
Patient Education: Acute dacryoadenitis is inflammation of the lacrimal (tear) gland, often causing pain, swelling and fullness at the outer upper eyelid. In many cases—especially when viral (e.g., EBV)—it improves on its own over days to weeks. What to expect and do: - Rest, avoid rubbing the eye, and apply cool compresses to the affected eyelid for comfort. - Take prescribed medications exactly as directed: antibiotics only if a bacterial cause is suspected; corticosteroids may be used if inflammation is significant and after your doctor’s evaluation. - Watch for warning signs that require urgent care: worsening pain, increasing swelling, fever, new decrease in vision, trouble moving the eye, or any pus/discharge. - Keep follow-up appointments so the doctor can confirm the inflammation is resolving and rule out other causes. - Most cases resolve without surgery; if symptoms persist or recur, further testing (blood tests or imaging) may be recommended.

Assessment
Assessment Narrative: 12-year-old boy with 1-week history of left upper eyelid swelling. Examination notable for redness and temporal fullness of the left upper lid with an S-shaped deformity, marked injection and chemosis of the lateral bulbar conjunctiva on manual eyelid elevation, enlargement and erythema of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, moderate tenderness over the enlarged lacrimal gland, and mild regional lymphadenopathy. Ocular motility and intraocular exam otherwise normal. Imaging may show lacrimal gland enlargement or mass without bony erosion or soft-tissue invasion. Clinical presentation and imaging consistent with an orbital dermoid cyst of the right orbit. Surgical excision via lid crease incision performed with complete removal; no postoperative sequelae.
Primary Diagnosis: Dermoid cyst of the right orbit
Differential Diagnosis: Lacrimal gland inflammation (dacryoadenitis); Dermoid/epidermoid cyst; Orbital cellulitis/abscess; Lacrimal gland tumor (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma, lymphoma)
Severity: Mild
Laterality: right
Complications: None reported


Plan
All Procedures: Surgical excision of orbital dermoid cyst via lid crease incision (complete excision).
Follow-Up Instructions: Routine postoperative follow-up for wound check and suture removal; monitor for recurrence, infection, or inflammatory reaction; return sooner if increasing pain, redness, swelling, discharge, fever, or vision changes.
Patient Education: A dermoid cyst is a benign, slow‑growing lump that often occurs near the eye and is made of tissue trapped under the skin. It can enlarge or rupture over time, causing inflammation. There is no medication that makes it go away. Surgical removal is recommended to prevent future irritation, inflammation, or cosmetic problems. Surgery is typically done through a small eyelid incision for a concealed scar; timing may be delayed in very young infants to reduce anesthesia risk. Risks of surgery include bleeding, infection, scarring, and rarely damage to nearby tissues. After complete excision the prognosis is excellent, with low risk of recurrence. If you notice increasing size, redness, pain, drainage, or changes in vision, seek prompt medical care.

Orbital CT showed a well-circumscribed retrobulbar lesion without bony change and only marginal contrast enhancement, consistent with a benign intradermal nevus/cavernous hemangioma–type lesion. Given clinical and radiographic features suggesting a benign eyelid/orbital tumor, observation versus surgical excision is appropriate. Excisional biopsy of the upper eyelid lesion was performed; histopathology confirmed intradermal nevus. No further treatment required; patient doing well without recurrence.
Primary Diagnosis: Benign eyelid tumor, most likely intradermal nevus
Differential Diagnosis: Intradermal nevus; seborrheic keratosis; squamous papilloma; hidrocystoma
Severity: Mild
Laterality: Left


Plan
All Procedures: Excisional biopsy of the upper eyelid lesion (office procedure under local anesthesia) with primary repair or allowed to heal by secondary intention as indicated and specimen sent for histopathologic examination
Follow-Up Instructions: The patient has done well without evidence of recurrence.
Patient Education: Benign eyelid tumor (intradermal nevus): slow‑growing, noncancerous lesion. Options include observation or simple surgical removal under local anesthetic in the office. Procedure risks: bleeding, infection, scarring, eyelid margin distortion, or slight change in eyelid position; care is taken to minimize these. Excised tissue is sent for pathology to confirm the diagnosis. No medical treatment is needed. If observed, return for follow‑up if the lesion changes in size, color, becomes painful, ulcerates, or causes eyelid irritation or vision changes.
